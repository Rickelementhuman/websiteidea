One way to test this is an implicit assocation test (IAT), which measures your 'implicit' (or <em id="""">subconscious</em>) associations by measuring reaction speed when being presented with them. <a href=""https://www.bitbrain.com/blog/implicit-association-test-iat"" id="""">You can read up about it here</a>. We have constructed the Element Human IAT test around measuring the subconscious associations between a brand - in this case <strong id="""">Norwich City Football Club</strong> - and a set of '<em id="""">brand values</em>'. We then compare how the associations differ between the Test group and the Control group. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/66985659610eac475fba4407_1698689559225.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Implicit Association Test for 'You Are Not Alone'. © Element Human</figcaption></figure><p id="""">As you can see, watching the ad significantly increased a number of subconscious associations. Norwich City was more associated with being '<em id="""">Authentic</em>', '<em id="""">Empathetic</em>' and '<em id="""">Inclusive</em>'. And by the looks of it, this ad was putting the Club into territory it hasn't previously had any associations with at all: only 6% of the Control group associated the Club with '<em id="""">Mental Health</em>', however this ad created an association with almost half of all viewers (46%). This is a jump of <strong id="""">640%</strong> - which I'd like to point out is the highest implicit association uplift Element Human has ever recorded.</p><h3 id="""">Driving Action</h3><p id="""">So the ad successfully created memory structures by associating the Club with relevant values within an emotionally intensive storyline. But what kind of action are we looking to see in viewers? In this case, we tested for an uplift in the likelihood to <strong id=""""><em id="""">check in on a friend this week and make sure they're doing OK</em></strong>.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/66985659f4d820e411ae095d_1698762506178.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Purchase Intent question for 'You Are Not Alone'. © Element Human</figcaption></figure><p id="""">Thankfully, the UK General Population are an empathetic lot, as the Control group already scored 68% for this.

Takeaway message: Quickly capture attention and evoke strong emotional reactions for maximum memory encoding and behavior changes.
","<p id="""">Since the Covid-19 pandemic, online retail has grown rapidly. With that comes smarter technology that allows companies to resonate with target consumers. Seems fair enough, that’s what companies have always tried to do, right? Right. However, before the age of TikTok and other social media giants, younger people were less exposed to the online world. </p><p id="""">In 2014, the average age of acquiring a mobile phone was 13 years old, with pay as you go limiting time spent online, averaging at 12.5 hours per week. Fast forward ten years and the average age of acquiring a mobile phone is just 9 years old, with a startling 25% of 3-4 year olds also using a mobile phone of their own. Children are now spending a minimum of 7 hours a day online (<em id="""">Source: </em><a target=""_self"" href=""https://revealingreality.co.uk/the-difference-a-decade-makes-10-years-of-childrens-media-lives/"" id=""""><em id="""">Children’s Media Lives 2024</em></a>).</p><p id="""">The scary part? Companies have realised the untapped marketing potential of these children. Advertising targeted toward children used to be solely via parents or TV ads, but now children are exposed to advertising around every virtual corner.</p><p id="""">Global Action Plan creatively demonstrated this point and just how terrifying it is in their latest campaign <em id="""">Stop Following Me</em>.

But what’s really interesting is the way that Global Action Plan demonstrated this point. Let's explore what worked and what didn't work.</p><p id="""">With Element Human’s testing suite you can take an ad creative and insert it into a social media environment to test how it performs in context. This means ad campaigns can be tested <em id="""">‘in the wild’</em>, offering the most accurate read of performance by collecting real human reaction data. Currently there are four different social feeds available: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts.</p><p id="""">For this test, I placed the ad in an Instagram environment and tested among 327 UK general population respondents.

The happiness in our viewers subsides and disgust takes over as they finally realise how serious of an issue ad targeting is.

Well, a study carried out by the BBC in collaboration with Element Human found that emotional intensity that is triggered earlier delivers a higher memory effect (<em id="""">Source: </em><a target=""_self"" href=""https://bbcnews.bbcstudios.com/advertising/insights/science-of-memory/"" id=""""><em id="""">BBC Science of Memory 2018</em></a>).</p><p id="""">So by placing peak emotional moments earlier on, we can better encode memories in our audience. This is beneficial for both raising awareness and driving action. We want the brand to be top of mind for the consumer the next time they consider making a purchase (or in this case, donating to a charity). </p><p id="""">Furthermore, the audience are more likely to raise awareness of the key issue as it is well encoded in their memory. But by failing to capture the audience sooner, a smaller group of people will be impacted by the ad and ultimately efforts are wasted - especially when a charity is trying to raise awareness of such a relevant issue.</p><p id="""">Takeaway message:<strong id=""""> Quickly capture attention and evoke strong emotional reactions</strong> for maximum memory encoding and behaviour changes.</p><p>‍</p><p id="""">If you’d like to find out more about Global Action Plan or donate to their cause then <a href=""https://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/"">click here.</a></p><p id="""">Written by <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgina-ferreira/"" id="""">Georgina Ferreira</a>, Data &amp; Insights Executive at <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.elementhuman.com/"" id="""">Element Human</a>.</p><p id="""">—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p id=""""><em id="""">This analysis contained only a small portion of the creative &amp; campaign metrics tracked by Element Human.

Great creatives can do great things, and all of this worked because CoorDown both moved us and stopped us in our tracks. ","<p id="""">Did you know that March (i.e. the third month in the year) was specifically chosen as World Down Syndrome Day to signify the uniqueness of the triplication of the 21st chromosome? In all honesty I didn’t know that, nor did I realise it was World Down Syndrome Day until earlier this week. There seems to be a lot we may not know about Down Syndrome and the lives of those with an extra chromosome. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/coordown/"" id="""">CoorDown</a> released a new campaign <em id="""">Assume That I Can</em>. CoorDown is an Italian charity that was officially established in 2003 but their work first started in 1987. CoorDown aims to raise awareness of the potential those with Down Syndrome have while also promoting their inclusion in school and the workplace by identifying issues in shared policies.</p><p id="""">I thought it would be interesting to see how audiences reacted to this ad using the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/elementhuman/"" id="""">Element Human</a> creative testing platform. Before we dive in, let’s take a look at the ad:</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://youtu.be/9HpLhxMFJR8""><div id=""""><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HpLhxMFJR8"" title=""ASSUME THAT I CAN | World Down Syndrome Day 2024""></iframe></div></figure><p id="""">‍<br>For me, the message was clear: our assumptions of those with Down Syndrome directly shape their reality, and if we can change those assumptions, we can unlock their true potential. But did this message resonate with audiences, and did it achieve cut-through in the busy social media environment for this little-known brand? </p><p id="""">With Element Human’s testing suite you can take an ad creative and insert it into a social media environment to test how it performs in context. This means ad campaigns can be tested <em id="""">‘in the wild’</em>, offering the most accurate read of performance by collecting real human reaction data. Currently there are four different social feeds available: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and just <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176165486680797185"" id="""">this week we released YouTube Shorts</a>. </p><p id="""">For my test, I chose two of Element Human’s test environments, <strong id="""">TikTok </strong>and <strong id="""">YouTube Shorts</strong>. By doing this I can see how ad performance compares across platforms (I’ll be exploring some of these differences later on). The test was run with a general population US audience, totalling 700 respondents across 2 x Tests and their Control groups. The Element Human system then tracks and records audience data comprising both biometric and survey that break down how the audience responded, what did and didn’t work, and how it impacted the brand across the funnel; all compared to deep performance benchmarks. The test incorporates four techniques:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Attention</strong> (via eye-tracking)</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Emotion </strong>(via facial coding)</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Memory </strong>(using an implicit association test)</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Brand uplift </strong>(using a post-view survey with traditional brand metrics)</li></ol><p id=""""><strong id="""">So how did it perform?</strong></p><p id="""">In the US market, CoorDown is not well known, so the brand had a challenge here to punch through with awareness of the brand and what they stand for, with an evidently powerful emotional creative. In the control group, Top of Mind Awareness of CoorDown in the category was literally 0% - however as a result of seeing the ad in-feed on TikTok, <strong id="""">Top of Mind Awareness jumped to 9%</strong>; which is very impressive performance and highlights just how attention-grabbing the ad was in-feed. Growing awareness from nothing is no easy feat and a true testament to the creativity of CoorDown’s latest campaign.</p><p id="""">And what messaging did CoorDown land with viewers? We tested this using Element Human’s Message Association Test. In this case the highest shift in agreement was <em id="""">‘CoorDown are challenging stigmas associated with Down Syndrome’</em>. (↑46%). The ad does an incredible job of revealing the lived experience of those with Down Syndrome through relatable scenarios that are turned on their head when you realise how differently a person with Down Syndrome is treated. Through powerful visuals and compelling narrative, this message is landed. </p><p id="""">We are off to a great start as CoorDown have already successfully<strong id=""""> increased awareness</strong> and<strong id=""""> landed their key messaging</strong>!</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6699b178d56361b20466bd75_1711029383746.gif"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">One of the real challenges of marketing on social media is the limited attention opportunity brands have these days. Ad-pacing has had to evolve to cope. TV ads used to start slow and build to a climax, but this doesn’t work in the world of Social. Brands are learning that attention is curved - for every second that elapses you lose a portion of your audience, so the key is to work to retain them and mitigate that loss. Clustered in a feed between a host of cat videos and influencers on perennial holiday, the key is to stand out, grab attention, and '<em id="""">buck the curve</em>'.<br></p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6699b17809670778ee5fa705_1711029408359.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">On TikTok, CoorDown delivered an in-feed attention score of 26 seconds. For a 90 second ad this may not sound like much, but this puts it in the<strong id=""""> top 8% of all TikTok ads</strong> tested on the Element Human platform (benchmarked against more than 50K data points).</p><p id="""">It just keeps getting better and better.</p><p id="""">So CoorDown grabbed attention quickly, and unlocked a substantial upper-funnel outcome, driving both Attention and Awareness. </p><p id="""">But how did it perform mid-funnel? One of the key aspects to measure is the emotional impact of the creative, and how that changed perceptions of the brand. Element Human has a particularly rigorous way of measuring this that taps into the subconscious associations that were created. Did you know that a lot of our buying decision-making comes from our subconscious? That’s why it’s important to look below the surface. </p><p id="""">An <strong id="""">implicit association test (IAT)</strong> measures your ‘implicit’ (or <em id="""">subconscious</em>) associations with a brand by recording your reaction speed when presented with a brand and a set of brand attributes (you can <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.bitbrain.com/blog/implicit-association-test-iat"" id="""">read more about it here</a>). For CoorDown we tested four brand attributes: <em id="""">Creative, Relevant, Thought-Provoking</em> and <em id="""">Trustworthy</em>.<br></p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6699b17830410e8dfd3274bf_1711029424307.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">This revealed that CoorDown had an issue with being seen as Creative. In fact, 25% of viewers had an implicit <em id="""">negative</em> reaction in the Control group, but the compelling creative significantly reduced this, whilst also delivering a <strong id="""">42% increase</strong> in positive association. </p><p id="""">So why, of all things, was an association with '<strong id="""">Creativity'</strong> the key mover here? The key is in the story....in the next section we’re going to see why CoorDown earned this change in perception by including an incredible jaw-dropping moment that viscerally demonstrates the potential of those with Down Syndrome in an unexpected way. </p><p id="""">Before we explore this, don’t forget that we also tested this ad inside YouTube Shorts, so how did the ad perform in both contexts?</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6699b178eee7f1ad335f4228_1711029444891.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">One of the biggest challenges in media measurement is understanding the power of context - just because your ad did well on one media channel, doesn’t mean it will do so on another. Context drives behaviour, and behaviour drives performance. On different platforms viewers behave differently, think differently and respond differently. Understanding how your creative performs in context can help you find your audience and optimise for context. </p><p id="""">We already know that ‘Creative’ had the biggest lift in implicit association, however what was interesting is how this was more effective on TikTok than YouTube Shorts for both Creative and Trustworthy. Clearly CoorDown can expect stronger mid-funnel performance on the TikTok component of their media plan. </p><p id="""">But what was it about the creative that drove these scores? Understanding key moments, what worked and why, is critical information that can help with content strategy. This is where emotion tracking comes into play. </p><p id="""">The first part of the ad was a hard watch as it dawned on me just how restricted the lives of those with Down Syndrome can be. And it looks like our viewers felt the same as we see a <strong id="""">rise in sadness</strong> during the first part of the video - look at the blue spike in the emotion story below.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6712cf494fea103b02e1b226_6699b2cea1c8d311e49e4ebc_CoorDownsAssumeThatICanadGif1-ezgif.com-optimize.gif"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit""></div></figure><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">But 60 seconds in is where the ad levels up. Our protagonist turns to the camera and says <em id="""">‘I learn fucking Shakespeare’</em>. It’s a shocking moment that causes us to suddenly re-evaluate the person on the screen - she’s real, badass and not taking any shit. She then throws it back at us with the line: ‘<em id="""">You assumed I can’t swear right?</em>’. In the age of sanitised advertising, dropping the F bomb is head-turning - and I am absolutely here for it.</p><p id="""">It’s self-examination happening in real time, and looking at the emotion data we can see that this is the cornerstone emotion moment of the piece.

Impressive numbers for an ad in a social media feed, particularly for a previously unknown brand.

There are a lot of prominent British charities in the market that make it hard to break through and achieve Top of Mind Awareness, so seeing a positive shift in awareness is a great start and a true testament to a great piece of creative.</p><p id="""">Next, I had a look at what messaging landed with our viewers using a Message Association Test. <em id="""">‘Across the UK millions of families cannot access basic human rights due to economic and social inequality’</em> - that’s the statement that viewers were most likely to agree with after watching the ad (80%), with an uplift of 22% compared to the control group.

Let’s look at the key emotive moments in <em id="""">Before Our Eyes</em> which is made simple with Element Human’s facial coding technology.</p><p id="""">Our first most shocking moment is when Olivia Colman is told that kids are often taken to hospital with housing related illnesses, they then leave and end up back in hospital again - but sometimes they don’t. This is the heartbreaking moment viewers realise that children are, in fact, dying because of the UK housing crisis.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6712cf5140642563f4c8347a_669a945ed8951d70084dc1fc_AmnestyInternationalGif1-ezgif.com-optimize.gif"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Then, our lead character, whose child passed away earlier, speaks in court. She tells the judge that she knows people must think this situation is her fault somehow but that she has tried everything and none of it mattered. This surprised viewers as they are left with another painful realisation.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6712cf5140642563f4c834ad_669a9468f67edc22f37423d3_AmnestyInternationalGif2-ezgif.com-optimize.gif"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Our final shock moment is when Olivia Colman reveals “This isn’t drama, this is real life”.

Has the ad impacted action? Let’s take a look.</p><p id="""">We asked viewers how likely they are to make a donation after watching the ad and just under half (47%) said they are likely to. But interestingly, when comparing different age groups, it seems that the younger viewers were much more likely to say they will make a donation, as you can see in the chart below:</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:852px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""852px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/669a93906c5bd1cffe29c6d2_1712133714886.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Purchase Intent by Age</figcaption></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">But just by viewing the ad we can see a total uplift of 22% in likelihood of donating - with similar uplifts across both age groups. Clearly this piece of creative impacted those of all age groups. </p><p id="""">But our older viewers are still overall less likely to donate, why is that? Well <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/292936/giving-to-charity-in-england-by-age/"" id="""">according to Statista</a>, as people age they are more likely to donate to charity, with 67% of those aged 50-64 currently donating to at least one charity in England. So if someone is already donating to charity this might impact their decision to donate to another, which is what we might be seeing in our data. So is marketing toward older people still effective in this case?</p><p id="""">I had a look at how likely our viewers are to recommend supporting Amnesty International to friends and family and the results were surprising: </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:966px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""966px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/669a939017559aca102b393e_1712133800672.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Recommendation by Age</figcaption></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">As you can see, those aged 45-65 are still overall less likely to recommend supporting Amnesty International than younger viewers. However, by viewing the <em id="""">Before Our Eyes</em> ad, we saw an uplift of 839% in likelihood of recommending among those aged 45-65! This is really interesting. It seems as though the ad was more likely to impact older viewers in terms of recommending others support Amnesty International rather than donating themselves. </p><p id="""">Furthermore, <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4908114/"" id="""">according to one study</a>, negative stimuli is less likely to motivate older adults to donate compared to younger adults - but older adults are more likely to feel a positive emotional reaction when they do donate compared to younger adults.</p><p id="""">So perhaps this ad had enough of an emotional impact to drive older viewers to encourage others to donate, rather than donating themselves to another charity. This highlights the importance of thinking about your target audience. In this case, we might not gain new support in the form of donations from older viewers, but they are likely to advocate due to the emotional swell they felt watching the ad.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Before Our Eyes </em>is a great example of how content type can impact different audiences. Our female viewers resonated more with the messaging as they put themselves in the position of our lead female character who has lost her baby due to poor housing. When it comes to action, our younger viewers felt more compelled to do something, as well as encourage others to do so as well. </p><p id="""">But most interestingly, we saw an impressive shift in our older viewers when it came to encouraging others to support Amnesty International. The lesson here: think about your target audience and the impact your content can have on them. Amnesty International gained a new group of older advocates and younger donators all from one powerful ad (and <a target=""_self"" href=""https://www.elementhuman.com/"" id="""">Element Human</a> made it easier and faster than ever to gather these learnings). </p><p id="""">What did you take away from watching the ad and reading this article?

Clicks, likes, shares – these metrics are ubiquitous, yet they often fail to tell the whole story. What about the <em id="""">why</em> behind the engagement? What emotions are driving user behavior? This is where pioneering a new approach to media measurement comes in. </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">From Stingray Attacks to Sensor-Driven Insights</strong></h3><p id="""">Matt's story begins with a dramatic near-death experience in Costa Rica, a harrowing tale of a stingray attack, necrosis, infection, and even misapplied heat treatments resulting in third-degree burns. This experience, while traumatic, underscores his resilience – a trait that would prove invaluable in navigating the challenges of building a startup.</p><p id="""">Element Human's mission is simple yet profound: to bridge the gap between technology and human interaction. Their approach uses sensor data, including facial coding and eye tracking, to understand not just <em id="""">what</em> users are doing, but <em id="""">why</em> and <em id="""">how</em>. This isn't about simply labeling emotions; it's about understanding the underlying behavioral patterns that drive engagement.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Beyond Likes and Shares: Unveiling the ""Guilty Pleasures""</strong></h3><p id="""">Matt's journey with Element Human has spanned four distinct iterations, each building upon the lessons learned from the previous one. Early versions relied on APIs and support vector machine models to analyze video expressions. Collaborations with the University of Nottingham and the BBC provided invaluable insights, revealing discrepancies between what users <em id="""">said</em> they felt and what their facial expressions <em id="""">actually</em> conveyed. This led to the discovery of a fascinating phenomenon: ""guilty pleasures."" Content that received low ratings but high engagement – a finding that significantly impacted the BBC's content inventory pricing.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Power of Multimodal Data: A Deeper Understanding of Attention</strong></h3><p id="""">Element Human's current offering is a sophisticated suite of tools that go far beyond simple click counts. They analyze a wealth of data, including facial expressions, eye movements, and even subtle body language cues, to provide a nuanced understanding of audience engagement. With over 30 billion data points collected across four platforms, they've developed a powerful machine learning feedback loop that helps brands understand what truly resonates with their audience.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Addressing the Challenges of the Creator Economy</strong></h3><p id="""">The influencer marketing landscape is booming, but measuring its effectiveness remains a significant challenge. With over 200 million creators and a 4.2 billion-strong audience, traditional metrics simply aren't enough. Element Human is tackling this challenge head-on, providing brands with validated metrics like brand recall, purchase intent, and brand uplift. Their approach allows for cross-platform comparisons, providing a much-needed level of standardization in a fragmented market.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Future of Behavioral Learning Models (BLMs)</strong></h3><p id="""">Matt envisions a future where Behavioral Learning Models (BLMs) – a natural extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) – will revolutionize how we understand human behavior. These models will go beyond the limitations of language, incorporating the rich context provided by body language and other sensor data. The potential applications are vast, ranging from UX/UI testing to mental wellness tracking.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Navigating the Ethical Landscape of Data Privacy</strong></h3><p id="""">Element Human is acutely aware of the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy. They emphasize that their facial coding technology is not facial recognition; it analyzes expressions without identifying individuals. Data is anonymized, access is highly restricted, and users have complete control over their data, including the ability to delete it at any time.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Lessons Learned: A Journey of Resilience and Innovation</strong></h3><p id="""">Matt's entrepreneurial journey has been far from easy. He's faced insolvency multiple times, requiring significant restructuring and scaling back. Yet, his unwavering positivity and resilience have propelled him forward. His advice to aspiring entrepreneurs? Validate your problem, prioritize people, find a strong co-founder, and avoid the ""growth at all costs"" mentality.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion: A Vision for the Future of Media Measurement</strong></h3><p id="""">Element Human is not just measuring engagement; it's decoding human behavior. By combining cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of human psychology, they're providing brands with the insights they need to create truly impactful content. Matt's journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, innovation, and a commitment to ethical data practices. </p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Full Transcript&nbsp;</h3><p id="""">[00:00:00] </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Emotions, emotions happen before people think. So if you ask somebody how they feel, you're actually asking them how they think they feel because whatever they felt has already happened. Being able to get landmarks on a face and be able to look at unique features on a face, that works. That side works.</p><p id="""">I'm going to separate facial coding from emotion. I, because emotion is a judgment call as to whether somebody is feeling happy or sad, or it's a probability as to whether somebody's feeling happy or sad. And that's where a lot of these models fall down. And I would be careful and reticent as a user to be putting a lot of weight behind the emotional labels.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> So facial coding data and insight space has been around for quite some time. Thank you. In simplistic terms, it's a technique that involves reading the signal or landmarks on a respondent's face to understand what [00:01:00] they're paying attention to and the reaction listed. It's widely used by a variety of companies, often to gauge reaction to advertising content.</p><p id="""">Many brands and agencies have bought into the theory. Facial coding data will give you a true, unfiltered reaction to content, understanding system one type reactions based on immediate or emotional rather than stated response. However, there's also been some skepticism around this type of data too. Not least around a number of key questions.</p><p id="""">How accurate is it? To what extent can you really categorize emotion? Self selected samples are engaging with the content, questions around consumer privacy, and a whole range of other issues. Well, Mat Saluzak addresses all those topics and many other very relevant points, including how Element Human, the company where he's the founder and CEO, takes a considered approach to this type of data, the use of behavioral learning models, and how human sensor data can empower the creator economy.</p><p id="""">I must give a disclaimer and that I'm on the board of element human. So I have some existing in going perspectives and [00:02:00] viewpoints that said, I hope you'll agree that we have a really good in depth discussion around my facial coding data and emotion. AI may go next and the impact on insights and marketing.</p><p id="""">So. Onto the interview. So Matt, it's good to track you down wherever you are in the world today, west coast of Canada. I've caught you on, I believe. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. Thanks Henry for having me here. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Not at all. It's very, very good to have you on. Now. I wanted to start off with a traditional icebreaker, which is something from your deepest, darkest past.</p><p id="""">No, it doesn't have to be deepest, darkest past. It's just something that most people wouldn't know about you. Something that might be a little bit surprising. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Okay. Well, I don't think you'd actually find it anywhere written anywhere, but I was actually stung by a stingray and almost lost my leg down in Costa Rica.</p><p id="""">Wow. How long ago did that </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> happen? </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Oh it was in my 20s. Also, 2 years </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> ago. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, I wish it was 2 years ago. No, my other leg reminded me just recently that how old I am with an Achilles rupture. So, yeah, [00:03:00] unfortunately, being active certainly gets you out there, but getting you out there certainly gets you exposed.</p><p id="""">So, yeah, no, I guess that's something that most people wouldn't know, but I spend a lot of time in the ocean and I really enjoy the ocean and, people know about my fishing. Some of them know about my kayaking, but, a big part of it out there is just getting out there and just being in the wild and a stingray stumbled across my leg and almost lost that thing.</p><p id="""">So </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> what, so what are the consequences of a stingray bite then? I mean, so clearly it does more than just really hurt. I mean, if you almost lost your leg. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. So, I mean, it really hurts. , not the most painful thing, but. Close to the challenge that you have is that the poison goes in and it starts to create necrosis.</p><p id="""">And so and unfortunately hit my lymph system. So I, the whole leg kind of started to swell up after three or four days. I couldn't really figure it out. And we just had to absolutely nuke and nuke myself with antibiotics, try and recover. And it was we, we ended up getting it back. It didn't help that we were [00:04:00] kind of, we were kind of remote Costa Rica at the moment.</p><p id="""">And so at the time it was very much, they said, put heat on it and or at least the doctor did and the people there that I was out with a bunch of kind of local guides and they were like, oh, they just it was hot is what they heard. And so they put these. Burning hot coals on, on the back of my leg and I got third degree burns.</p><p id="""">And so just to make it, just to make it even better, just complicated the whole issue. It's the first time I've ever bit down on a stick to handle the pain. It was quite interesting anyway. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Oh, well, that was probably, that was probably very good preparation of burning hot coals, biting down on sticks, extreme pain for getting into the startup journey in the startup world, but you'll get it.</p><p id="""">So we'll get maybe into your background a little bit, which is interesting in itself, but can we just start with Element Human and its various sort of iterations and why did you found the business and what were you looking to do? </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, I, [00:05:00] so my co founder Diego and I founded the business based on a kind of one simple principle.</p><p id="""">We were realizing that. People were starting to spend more time interacting with technology in the outside world than they were with human beings. And I think we can all say that even our interactions with humans, we're going through technology, but technology was still in a very binary stage. I mean, we founded this in 2013.</p><p id="""">So this is still when people were in the marketing industry. We're all like, Ooh, mobile phones are going to take over. And And so we had heard about kind of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we thought, well, if people have kind of cameras and microphones and all this really rich data that we get out of, say, a focus group, or out of 1 to 1 interviews that contextualizes everything, could we create a nice feedback loop that complements this big data?</p><p id="""">But very kind of broad data set that that's, that's not very granular. And so we wanted to work on generating human behavior signals and emotional signals [00:06:00] out of a sensor data. And we just believe that sensor data offered this kind of body language feedback loop helped us really unpack kind of why and how people are doing things rather than just what they're doing.</p><p id="""">So that's kind of where we got started. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Matt, when you were saying censored data, we're kind of diving into the nitty gritty of it now. I mean, so obviously it was always survey based, I believe, was it? The in terms of element humans solution. Oh, it wasn't. Okay. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> No, no, no, no. So our 1st iteration was actually an API where you could just send a video to us and we would translate what the expressions and emotional signals were.</p><p id="""">And that was using early day support vector machine models. So, it was really good. And then we teamed up with the University of Nottingham. And and then we started, it was BBC who asked us to bake it into a survey to demonstrate the value, because what we were learning is that people would express differently than they would claim.</p><p id="""">So we would have the, the expression, and then we'd have what they claim. And then those 2, they would contradict and where they [00:07:00] contradicted ended up being where the insight was. So that actually ended up being the leading indicator as to where, whether a piece of content would perform or not at the BBC, but that's where we were incubated.</p><p id="""">And that's when we ended up. Putting it into survey the 4th, sorry, the 3rd generation of the tool was actually an embeddable. So it was again. Being able to flip on a webcam, do I tracking emotion detection and implicit testing and and as a researcher, you could just plug that into a survey and then it was, it wasn't until this 4th.</p><p id="""">Generation that we ended up taking over the survey, the sample, all that stuff, because we realized quality control for rich data was, was important. So part of that is trying to design out the human variability enough while creating a natural enough human experience. So, and yes, by owning the survey allows you to do that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah, yeah, got it. It's really interesting. I mean, going back to that point that you made around the difference between claims data. And behavioral data, [00:08:00] you may have used a different phrase now. I forget exactly what it was, but then, but then, but then how did you start to discern, you said the truth was somewhere in between or the intersection gave the truth, but how did you start to discern where the truth in inverting comma would lie?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> The first kind of big project where it became quite clear that there was a whole different type of signal you can get from, from interacting with people and sensor devices was when we had people rate. Trailers of the BBC in multiple markets, and then we had them react to those trailers or just watch it naturally and see how they reacted.</p><p id="""">And you'd get people, it ended up creating kind of a 2 by 2, where you'd have kind of a rating that was high, low and a reaction that was larger or small. And we could very clearly see that there were people who would rate high and react high, and that was high engagement, true engagement. There was people who would rate high and react low.[00:09:00] </p><p id="""">And those are people that were more. They fill out surveys and they want to say that they would watch that show because their friends do. But actually when, when you went deeper, they didn't know much about the show itself and they actually wouldn't watch it. Then re when, when they would kind of rate low and react low, that was just not a very good piece of content for them.</p><p id="""">It's not a good audience fit. And then the final one was the really interesting one was where it would rate low, but it would react high and where it was rating low on the reaction was high. We were actually able to. Those were always the shows that over outperformed prime time average. And so we found out that we could actually anticipate beating prime time average about which shows in which markets would do well.</p><p id="""">And so that held the BBC price, their inventory for those markets and selling in. So it was these we call them the guilty pleasure. It's these shows that you would never admit. That you would watch, but when they're on, you're never going to turn them off. So, you know, the Jerry springers, the, you know, the, the, the, the talk TV show, [00:10:00] some of those ones where you wouldn't want anybody, you wouldn't want your friends knowing that you actually watch this, but when you watch it, you love it.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah, well, yeah, I think we're all aware of all sorts of guilty pleasures. We're all </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> aware of which ones those are from the press. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> But that, that is interesting in that it's, so it wasn't really one or the other. It genuinely was an intersection of saying by putting the two core data sources together You get much, you get a much more nuanced picture as to what the reaction is.</p><p id="""">Yeah. Kind of interesting, man. You should I realized I know what element human does very well, but you should probably actually describe what element human does for people who are less familiar with the business. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, sure. So I, I mean, in its current articulation Element human is very much we work on trying to take sensor data and learn how people behave or react to any interaction they have with the device today.</p><p id="""">That articulation is in ads and add measurement and media measurement. The media [00:11:00] measurement industry or the media industry in particular, particularly during COVID kind of hit this new bubbling up influencer and creator economy, which has over 200 million creators conversing with 4. 2 billion people, 365 days a year.</p><p id="""">It's a whole different form of marketing. It offers the largest untapped market in the world. And there's absolutely no way to measure across platforms at the moment. And the old traditional TV metrics are really hard to apply because it's a non linear format. There's a lot of user interaction control.</p><p id="""">The media formats are changing or expanding. So how do you compare a Snapchat with a Facebook media buy? And how do you know whether your content's better on YouTube or Instagram? YouTube shorts or Instagram real. So those kind of common questions became real challenges. A for the platforms to prove their value.</p><p id="""">Their unique value and their qualitative value but also be for the media buyers and then see for the creators themselves. So how do I stand out in [00:12:00] these platforms? If I can make money from this early days, there were very few creators and a lot of ad dollars available for experimentation. Now, total opposite.</p><p id="""">There's creators coming on a dime a dozen. There's a lot of content that's being pushed. People are kind of tuning out these feeds. You've heard of the doom scrolling and that type of stuff. So attention's really important. So the question for a creator is how do I capture attention and how do I get them to stay with me?</p><p id="""">That also, that also ladders up to the platform level and then further ladder ladders up to the brand performance level. So we're working with. Pioneers in this space Whaler, Twitch, and the BBC to understand what is really good quality content that's going to grab people's attention in the context of the environment.</p><p id="""">And how does that allow each of those type of stakeholders, creators, brands, agencies, or platforms be able to articulate their unique proposition and the value of that proposition in a measurable way. So instead of. Measuring kind of clicks, likes, and [00:13:00] shares, which are okay for audience growth, but not great for brand performance.</p><p id="""">Instead of being able to, instead of kind of valuing what's measured, which is what the whole programmatic industry is kind of based off of, it's flipping it on its head to, to, to measure what's valued. And I think that's. That's where sensor data is really interesting because it's a super rich data source where surveys can't give you that context.</p><p id="""">You get this really rich data source and you could kind of, it creates a machine learning feedback loop where you can kind of learn that against whatever metric that matters. So. First and foremost, it's an ad testing tool for campaign measurement. It's been used by over kind of 200 brands. We've road tested this for the last four years.</p><p id="""">We've got over 30 billion data points and benchmarks across four big platforms. It's a, it's pretty cool from that perspective. But it's got a long way to go too. There's a lot of. The question is, what else can body language teach us? What else can we learn it against? It's a hyper contextual source of information.</p><p id="""">And I think just to put this in [00:14:00] context, for every like, Like a thumbs up that you get on a YouTube video, we're getting over 10, 000 data points. So for every single data point you're getting on a YouTube video from a like perspective, we're getting over 10, 000. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> And Matt, we'll get into that, I think, in a second as to what you mean by those 10, 000 data points and exactly what you're measuring, but playing it back a little bit.</p><p id="""">So it sounds like there are multiple propositions in that you've got, I guess, the old Kind of insights propositions been around for quite a long time of, you know, survey, gauging the effectiveness of your advertising, whether from a creative perspective in terms of you're making the advertising, you want to make it better that that's a use case.</p><p id="""">But it also sounds like there's a really interesting use case too, in terms of. Areas in the digital world, particularly the influencer world, whereby there isn't really a lot of measurement at the moment, </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> there's, there's no measurement to be honest. And the measurement that does exist, it's usually cost prohibitive.[00:15:00] </p><p id="""">So our goal with the creator economy is to create something that was. Super fast, fast enough for influencer, reliable enough for brands and for platforms and agencies and, and, but also cost effective so that it could scale. A lot, but also accessible to these influencers who might actually be pre revenue in their own personal journeys.</p><p id="""">And so how do you attract brands in a language that they speak, but in a way that's useful to you so you can, you have a feedback loop, so it's worth asking your followers for, for to review your content. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> So, so the use case in that side of things is one of which is fine. You get your followers to review the content, you show it to them, you get the feedback in a survey environment and also using facial coding and potentially other metrics, you could make better content, but then if a brand is looking to buy from, say, I was an influencer, then I can actually start to give them some [00:16:00] validated metrics around recall or purchase intent or some type of brand uplift.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, so exactly. So it's brand uplift, brand recall, full funnel analysis. It provides all that. And so that, yeah, on </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> that side of it, could you just talk through in simple terms to people who aren't familiar? So how does the methodology work at the moment? It's mainly a survey based methodology, but then what, what, what happens just very high level if you're a respondent and you go to that survey and then what does the client get at the end of it?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, so so client, I think we handle the sample, our partners sent. So they, and they're one of the main industry providers for, for participants. So you basically just go into the platform, you upload your creative, upload a few kind of brand goals and objectives, and then and then you select the audience you want to go to.</p><p id="""">Then we, then a link gets sent out to the, the, our partner sample [00:17:00] partner. Some. People like Twitch bring their own samples. So some, some of them plug us into their own customer databases and communities. And then the link goes out, they agree. They consent to do it. They turn on their webcam. That's part of it.</p><p id="""">It is entirely privacy based and we'll get into privacy in a second, but they turn on their webcam and as they're filling out the survey, they're being observed and then they get to the points of where they're popped into a mock feed or they're exposed to the content. If it's just a simple creative test.</p><p id="""">And then there, then we also do test and control. So there is a group of a hundred people who will be done as the control group to be able to compare all the results and see what the differences are. So that's what creates our benchmarks. That's what allows us to do uplift and recall and awareness, consideration, all that stuff.</p><p id="""">And then you can see how much you actually would compare to it, either a GenPOP population or a more targeted control population, if you want. From a brand, there's essentially 3 products create, measure, learn. From a create perspective, you understand where, where [00:18:00] people are paying attention, what's catching their attention, which objects and scene and elements inside the creative is capturing their attention.</p><p id="""">You get to understand where the emotional key moments are. So what are the parts of the. Creative that are actually driving their engagement continuous engagement within the creative and you can get some emotional context as well. Kind of some of the labeling around kind of happy sad, that type of expression that's being reviewed and then on the, measure it's very much your traditional brand metrics funnel analysis, all that type of stuff. We also have implicit traits. So you can, I understand. Is it authentic? Are you trustworthy? Are you sustainable? Whatever your brand goal is, are you actually getting there? And that's a subconscious kind of yes, no.</p><p id="""">And then the final bit of course is learning. So once you have all that data across a bunch of your data sets, you can then learn your own bespoke metrics for you as a customer, or you can start to pipe in say your sales data and machine learn against that. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Got it. [00:19:00] Got it. And to ask the million dollar question, hopefully, maybe literally the million dollar question.</p><p id="""">So, facial coding data and eye tracking, does it really work? You know, inside agencies have looked at this for a long time. And I think, you know, some cases have had trouble with it in terms of shaky cameras, self, self selected respondent groups. for your time. Problems with beards, you know, whatever, whatever the, you know, whatever the issues kind of maybe so I know that you're going to say it's really, really improving, but what's your kind of honest evaluation at the moment of the strengths and weaknesses of facial coding data.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, so, so facial coding facial coding data or, or facial recognition data, I mean, frankly, has been around for yonks. And I mean, does it work? I mean, some governments are using it to do automated border control. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Okay, yeah, true. Yeah. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So, quite frankly, the facial [00:20:00] coding stuff works and the computer vision side behind the facial.</p><p id="""">Coding and more specifically facial recognition work. So being able to get landmarks on a face and be able to look at unique features on a face. That works. That side works. The side that I'm going to separate facial coding from emotion. AI because emotion is a judgment call as to whether somebody is feeling happy or sad, or it's a probability as to whether somebody's feeling happy or sad.</p><p id="""">And that's where a lot of these models fall down. And I would be careful and reticent as a user to be putting a lot of weight behind the emotional labels. What the emotional labels are doing is they're mathematically taking a probability of somebody say smiling and saying, well, we have labeled this smile as happiness.</p><p id="""">And that is highly dependent on two things. One is your training dataset. So who you've trained against. So if you've only trained against non bearded people, Bearded people are probably going to fool the system because of the way that the [00:21:00] machine learning, supervised machine learning works. The other thing the other challenge that you have is a universal agreement on what emotions are and how to label them.</p><p id="""">There's a reason why body language goes largely unlabeled. Even in human construct the word love and the emotion love in English is summarized in one word in Sanskrit. It's 96 words. So, so, so there's 96 different variations that you can get in Sanskrit to describe the same emotional feel. You and I.</p><p id="""">Would have entirely different perspectives of what happiness means to each of us. And I think that has been the biggest misnomer is actually less in the technology itself and more in the theory of emotional modeling. And so what I would what I would caution any user on in this space. Because of course, it's always improving because the technology is always improving.</p><p id="""">Mathematically, you can get facial points off a face pretty accurately. You can deal with the human variability movement now [00:22:00] with the high quality webcam. So if you tested this 4 years ago, you would have been experiencing human variability for mobile webcam movement. Today, that is pretty much gone because it's it's pretty easy to lock onto a face on a moving and moving.</p><p id="""">So, so 2 moving objects back and forth. So that stuff's pretty much gone. The racial issues that were happening. A lot of those are gone now because of the way that cameras have improved. But the part that still I would say be very careful is the labels that you're using and your interpretation as a user of those labels.</p><p id="""">So we offer the labels but we offer the standard Ekman labels and we only offer it in the create function because they're only useful in saying were you intending to get people to smile here if you weren't. Then they are smiling. That's what we can tell you. If we are saying, were you intending to make people disgusted here?</p><p id="""">Well, we did a trial on disgust and just the different ways that people express and react to disgust. We had Bear Grylls [00:23:00] eating an exploding bug and. People would grimace, people would laugh, people would cover their face, people would turn away from the screen, people would lean into the screen.</p><p id="""">Everybody had a very different reaction, so you can't really model that. What you can model is there's a lot of expressional movement going on, and therefore that's a key moment. And so the key moment stuff is very, Solid, very expressional emotional interpretation is very psychological. The 1 thing I would say, and this is what a lot of people get wrong is that they think that emotions don't work.</p><p id="""">The reality is, is that you're not going to get a better emotional read. Then you're not going to get a better emotional read anywhere else. That is at least objectively validated because the psychologist will give you their view and that opinion and a focus group is, is just too small. And so you have and the ability to anticipate, truly anticipate an emotional level, depending on how you ground truth it is just so difficult that even at 50 percent accuracy rate of [00:24:00] emotion, or whether it's 80 percent accuracy of emotion, depending on which 1 you're trying to express that's still.</p><p id="""">A lot better than a 20, 30 percent that you're going to get in a human. So the here, I would say the, where it has been massively misused in the market research industry is people think that emotions and facial coding is to scale up to quantify. Qualitative element and it's not, it is to scale qual, not to enrich quant and I think you have to be really careful about that.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah, that's a really interesting distinction. And so, Matt, so what can you quantify then? You can quantify the modes. You can quantify the movements. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, so what's what's hyper accurate at the individual level is whether we've detected a face, whether we have actual landmarks on that face, and all the vectors that go in between.</p><p id="""">So all these vectors, you might have like 200. Or 56 to 1000 data points on a phase, and then those will [00:25:00] ladder up into what we call classifications. So happiness sadness, and that's looking at certain muscle groups predetermined by an emotional model. Our view in this whole world is that that's in this whole space is that that's actually the wrong way to approach a problem.</p><p id="""">Our job is not to go in there and tell you what emotion they're feeling. Necessarily, our job is to see if body language and behaviors are indicative or leading indicator of a metric that matters to you and your business. So, by having this really rich data on the face, you then as Coca Cola might say, well, when we see brand lift go by X, that means we've hit our happiness moment.</p><p id="""">Okay, then your version of happiness can be machine learned against that. That metric and we will tell you it turns out vector three. 475 and 989 are all indicators, strong indicators and predictive indicators of that [00:26:00] performance, and that's a much better mathematical way to do things in the emotion space than trying to label somebody's emotions because our language is just frankly too limited.</p><p id="""">And it's the wrong question. Emotions, emotions happen before people think. So if you ask somebody how they feel, you're actually asking them how they think they feel, because whatever they felt has already happened. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> What, so what did you mean by the vector example you just gave there? </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> You have a bunch of landmarks on a face and then vectors are the space between the landmarks.</p><p id="""">So we track how, how much they move back and forth. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Okay, so if you </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> can imagine a face with a face mask that has a bunch of dots on it, we'd be tracking those dots. And as the person moves their face or moves to and from the camera, we're tracking the distances. And those distances are the things that tell you whether there's expressional movement or not, and whether that expressional movement is a large enough, a relevant deviation from the norm.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Interesting. And again, drilling kind of quite deep here, [00:27:00] but I like to geek out on this stuff, as you know, what exactly are you tracking? So it's the face you're tracking. It's not broader body movement. It's just the face. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So the way that we built our system is you can kind of You can have it recognize any part of the body if you wanted it to so if it was, if the interaction was broader body movement, great, but television media at this point in time, and that's where a lot of the consumption is for people.</p><p id="""">It's a pretty passive activity, so face is probably the most expressive and most telling hand occlusion you'll see. Time to time hand occlusions good and eye tracking and head gaze. So eye tracking head movement, those fall within the vectors of the face. So that, so we would track those as well.</p><p id="""">Who knows, we might find out that a nose flare twitch might be indicative of you know, high sales for the toothpaste category. But we just don't know that yet. The key is to get the really rich data first, and then be able to link it to whatever metrics you want. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Which probably actually links into the next question I was about to ask.</p><p id="""">Things [00:28:00] like audio and strength of their reaction when they're speaking. I imagine companies must be exploring that as well. I mean, there's a big rise in open ended open ended responses through audio. Is that something you've been looking at as well? Or do you feel like there's enough to work on with, broadly, with the face?</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> No, so multimodal has always been our our end game and the models that we build are kind of input agnostic. They need to take on any sensor data. So sensor data to us is anything that will have any features that could be extracted from an input on a time series. So for us, that's kind of sensor data.</p><p id="""">So. The data structures are the same. So then like, okay, let's put audio in it and see if that works. Let's put galvanic skin response in it and see if that works. So, so it's about, I mean, we really the core product that the one that isn't seen on the website, but the core product that powers all this is we call it the human behavior data lab.[00:29:00] </p><p id="""">It's a very ugly long name, but it's, that's what it is. And it's purely meant for experimentation because we don't know where these sensors are going to be relevant. What I do like about that approach though, is that a, that a client can come in. We can say, great. All the survey stuff ticks the box for your measurement, the learning element.</p><p id="""">We're going to tell you now what's actually relevant, and then we could fine tune the data capture around what's relevant. And so that allows them again, this optimization process allows any business or any creator to really scale up their measurement. And if they want to scale up measurement, then they get that constant feedback loop.</p><p id="""">And, and that, that's, that's how we expect to standardize the industry. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> One of the other big factors we touched on this very briefly earlier is privacy. I mean, I'd imagine that must be a pretty big consideration within this space. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. My, I mean, my, my early work right at the beginning, we were helping the digital catapult feed into GDPR.</p><p id="""">So [00:30:00] coming from market research, you kind of. Yeah. I mean, even straight out of academia into market research your kind of privacy is kind of hammered into you from an ethics perspective. What I love about facial coding data is is that it's not facial recognition. It's built on the same principles of facial recognition mathematically, but it's actually not facial recognition.</p><p id="""">So I actually don't need to know who you are to know how you're expressing. And, and it's because I literally just start to retrospectively normalize how you're reacting to this, this, this environment. So I kind of liken it to a comedian on stage. Stage really has a clear feedback loop. They know when a joke fails and when a joke wins, right?</p><p id="""">They don't know the individuals in the audience, but they know if their content's working or not. So that's what I love about this technology is it offers at the individual level, our data agreement as a data controller is with the individual. So no matter how much a client might want to get access to the face videos, nobody has access.</p><p id="""">Even I don't have access to [00:31:00] those. Nobody has access to the face videos. It is highly protected. There are two people in our company who can access the face videos to maintain or to train and that's it. And it is entirely separated even by like proper Server design, it's entirely separated from the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p id="""">So even if you hacked through the client portal to get the client data, it wouldn't, you wouldn't be able to get through to the other side of it. Well, I mean, you might, but you'd have to work hard to get out of it. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah. It's an interesting point you make as well around the fact </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> that there is just one more thing, I apologize.</p><p id="""">And then one more thing is on the individual side because our relationships with the individual, we just said, you control it. We capture enough data that we can give. A strong enough result to a business and and I have an acceptable loss. So if. People want to delete their data. They, we give them a code right at the end of the survey that they can just email to privacy and their record isn't deleted forever.[00:32:00] </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Oh, we got, that's a very nice touch. I haven't heard about other companies doing that. I don't know if they are or not. I was just thinking about it. That's an interesting. Point that you make as well, that it in some ways you are not interested in who the individual is at all. In fact, the absolutely not interested.</p><p id="""">Yeah. Yeah. The, the last thing you want is individual responses. What you want is aggregate responses, correct? </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> yeah. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> We, we need what, what we need for us, our focus is to make the individual stuff the small, rich data as accurate as possible so that the aggregate data on top. fulfills its need, but so that you also need less and less people and you can kind of synthetically fill in the rest.</p><p id="""">So the key, the key is then winning the trust of the individual. And in that case, it's giving them full autonomy and power over what they've provided. It given them the ability to delete it right away. And frankly, once we have our metadata, we're not carrying anything that's personally identifiable. Okay, </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Matt, you're continuing my education BLMs.</p><p id="""">Behavioral learning [00:33:00] models. You know, I think I'm just about getting my head around LLMs. So what are behavioral learning models? </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Well, it just the, I would argue the natural extension. Once you've got LLMs in play that can kind of accurately predict what the next word's going to be or can actually generate the next word and synthesize kind of a thought, then a BLMs are.</p><p id="""">But they work on, I would say language is just relatively limited. Again, I use the love example as a very good example of this, but language is relatively limited. It's a, it's a synthesis and a summarization of our thought, whereas body language tends to be much more contextual. So BLM is very simple. I think of it as simple as the body language physics engine.</p><p id="""">for the future. So taking the principles of LLMs and applying it to human behavior and emotion. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> And then how does that work then in practice? So it's like, [00:34:00] you know, an LLM is looking at what a combination of words and it's predicting the next words and then it optimizes over time. And so for element human for a BLM, what you're looking at, let's just stick with the face, you're looking at the.</p><p id="""">The physical reaction, and then you're calibrating it against a certain data set. And then </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> so again, calibrating, yeah. So you want to calibrate against the metrics that matter the whole principle of the business is to kind of bring empathy to digital interactions or the internet and those interactions.</p><p id="""">So I would say nothing's ever going to be done in isolation of just the face. Making an emotional call, what you want to do is you want to make sure you have some sort of feedback loop in there. So some sort of pre cognitive post cognitive feedback. So here's the emotional data set. And then did they click a button?</p><p id="""">Did they move through the website? Did they leave the website? Whatever it [00:35:00] might be, whatever that interaction might be, did they leave the app? Do they click on something? That's the feedback loop. So you want to link it into something that that's relevant. So I wouldn't look at. You could look, try to look for a signal that is predictive on its own, right?</p><p id="""">I would argue, behavior, behaviors are very contextual, but they are contextual to an event that people have thought about and then done. So we're looking, we're trying to find leading indicators to, to events that are commonly executed on in a digital interaction, right? So a survey is one way to do that.</p><p id="""">But Frankly, I actually see kind of the big, one of the bigger use cases for this, two in general, one is in UX UI testing. So every website could put it on kind of like hot jar. And it's like 1 percent of people that visit the website could actually flip on their webcam or they have the element human app and they just pop it in.</p><p id="""">And that's where we'd want to go again, future scope, not currently. [00:36:00] And then further though, if we are accurate enough, we do see enough kind of interesting. States like boredom, depression, things like that. We can get into mental wellness tracking as well, which again would be inter somebody interacting with their device regularly and being able to say, hey, look, you seem to be excitable here after these events.</p><p id="""">You seem to be depressed after those events. So it's about that. What's exciting. What's draining and being able to optimize your life that way if you wanted to, or teach the machine to actually recognize this stuff. So it can say, hey, it's time to stand up and take a break. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah, obviously that would be the next stage of it.</p><p id="""">I mean, you can very much see where that could go though. Yeah, unequivocally, as you said, we we're monitoring, but behavior it is the </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> interaction. Yeah, it is about the interaction. The interaction today is a survey and, and it's a survey with an embedded experience of a feed like a TikTok feed. And so that's, that's the interaction today and that's where, that's our learning ground to be able to identify these other sig, other signals.[00:37:00] </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Is everybody doing that at the moment from a UX perspective? I could see it's a very, you could see it's a very compelling use case of, as you say, just asking a percentage of people just to be monitored. You incentivize them to do it, see what they're doing, and then start to track what their, yeah, what the emotional reaction is.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So there's I'd say there's three barriers to preventing that from mainstay adoption, mainstream adoption. The, the 1st 1 is technical in the sense that you have to have X, Y coordinates from the eye tracking against the X, Y pixel or mouse. Coordinates or what's on the page and your areas of interest, and then be able to summarize the emotional state of the areas of interest.</p><p id="""">That is all assuming that you have a very good probability model on the emotional state, which I don't agree has really been nailed yet. There are 2 companies out there that I think are doing some, some really good work in this area. Ours is probably the most raw data set. So we're going to be [00:38:00] building our own model around that stuff.</p><p id="""">We'll see. The 2nd barrier to entry is trust. Frankly, I don't know if I would go on to any website, particularly with the day, the way the data privacy has been abused in the past. I don't think I would actually go on and even say consent to any website unless I had full control of the data that went over there and could retrospectively remove that control the data and, and have full and final and total deletion.</p><p id="""">So that to us, we've, we think that that's an area we can own. And that's a very interesting area. And we like that area that we've played a lot there. We've got a pretty good ethics committee for review on that. We've said no to some very big, big financial gain opportunities to specifically not work in that space.</p><p id="""">So. Trust the technology itself. And then the 3rd is the variability. It's hard to take 1 models assumption that works for 1 [00:39:00] website and assume that it's going to work for the next website. And that variability also translates into human variability of people use different devices on for different types of sites and different types of workflows.</p><p id="""">And so I think it's a much broader problem. Even brought even more variant, more broad than than marketing. So, I marketing is kind of that happy medium. It's not as isolated as, like, trying to detect, you know, yawning from drivers and autonomous vehicles or whatever it is or, or, or enhanced vehicles.</p><p id="""">But that's a much more isolated workflow, but the variability in UX UI design is almost intractable. I would say. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Okay. Yeah, that, that does make sense. Broadly, I'm conscious of time. And I wanted to talk about the business actually a little bit as well. Not, not necessarily the detail of your journey. But it would be good just to get like a little bit of an overview of the evolution of the business.</p><p id="""">And then also kind of what [00:40:00] you've learned along the way. I mean, as an entrepreneur doing this business since whenever, I'm sure there have been ups and downs and you've probably got all sorts of elements of insights to, to pass on to others. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, I mean I think, wow, well, so let's just say there's kind of been 4 iterations of the business and I touched on this before.</p><p id="""">1st was the algorithms weren't really accessible outside of a university. So the 1st was plugging those into an API and that business was great, but there just weren't enough people building products commercially to create enough feedback for us to be able to get. The insight today that might be a different story.</p><p id="""">The second one was then something that we packaged up as a demo solution called MIMO. And that one was good for the broadcast industry, but the broadcast industry deals were still being done. Predominantly rights holders deals were still being done by handshake agreement. So great, but it wasn't a big enough uplift or certainty.</p><p id="""">[00:41:00] For sales, and there was a lot of resistance from salespeople of having the technology, tell them which show to sell for the upside. So, so we didn't quite nail that, that product proposition. The 3rd 1 then was for the market research industry of giving them something that they could embed that met the heavy skepticism as you talked about.</p><p id="""">But even those that would take it, it didn't create a recurring revenue model for us. So And they hated recurring revenue models, because they don't want to carry a cost base that they, they can't guarantee that they'll use. And a lot of market researchers are ad hoc sales, their sales cycles ad hoc.</p><p id="""">So they would use us in their sales decks to win the deals, but then not use us ultimately in, in, in delivering the goods. And then the, the, and now that 1 Well, at each one of those the change came from staring at insolvency papers. So going, okay, we're going to have to put this business under, scale it back and redo it.</p><p id="""">Then the last kind of This, this current product has been a very [00:42:00] interesting journey because it was actually going the right way. It had a very strong product market fit. It was serving the marketers inside the media industry, particularly from the media owner standpoint, actually, surprisingly, whereas a lot of the attention providers were serving the media agencies for media buying.</p><p id="""">And and I, I would say on that one, though, COVID hit after the first tranche of three funding hit. Obviously, everybody got skittish. Some tough conversations had to happen. I had to let go of a really good team. And we scaled back. A couple people stayed through. Then after COVID hit, the The recession threats hit and we were trying to go for series a funding and that didn't go through.</p><p id="""">So we had to hit another reset button. And at that time, we were just like, I'd say the biggest thing is cut deep and cut once. If you ever have to make cuts having been through a few rounds of cuts, it sucks. It's a very, very. Visceral human experience, [00:43:00] but also surround yourself with the people who've got your back.</p><p id="""">Even if you do fail, and I think that one's real hard. And so, like, Diego, my co founder through and through has had my back. And I'd say if you get lucky enough to find a good partner through business. Hold on to that. I think, yeah, I, I hate giving advice. I'd say that the biggest things that I would probably tell myself are always, always, always, no matter what you do, even if the business has to move in a certain direction, be people for be just be human about it.</p><p id="""">I've listened to a lot of lawyers and follow the legal process process does win the day. God, you can avoid a lot of pain if you're real human about it. And I definitely didn't nail it on a few of those conversations. I, I, I messed it up in a number of ways. And that was a big one. Co founders love them to death and, and make sure you always, you know, keep working on being the right fit.</p><p id="""">They're there, it's a [00:44:00] marriage because you're going to need, you're going to need the energy when you don't have it. And they just, they put rocket fuel in the tank when you need it. And then also, you know, really understand your business stage. I didn't understand your business stage in the market. This whole idea of growth at all costs just never really gelled with me, but I tried to live it and I failed at every turn only to, to when I went back to my core, this is what I believe in.</p><p id="""">And the moment I did that. Everything started to work, like it's just really weird. It just started to work. And, and again, I think that's believing yourself as a founder and all that type of stuff. I mean, you're told no, you're an idiot and your ideas are dumb and you're selling snake oil and all that type of stuff.</p><p id="""">And you're like, well, I still think it's, I still think empathy and body language or empathy is really important in a world of the internet. And I still think the body language is probably our key identifier of, of how to empathize. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Well, thank you, Matt. I know it's [00:45:00] been quite a journey. I also know it's, it's on an upward swing and I think we'll continue to be so.</p><p id="""">Now talk about an upward swing and we should jump onto a quick fire round, but I'm going to invert these questions slightly because I happen to know that you got married fairly recently. So I don't know, I don't want to know what you think your best and worst characteristics are. I want to know what your wife thinks your best and worst characteristics are.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So in anticipation of this, I went and I said, I know Henry, he typically asks some of these questions listen to your podcast. And so I actually had a conversation with her. So the best characteristics, she said positivity. She's like, you're, you're sickingly positive. And she said, like, even in the middle of the night.</p><p id="""">When you can't sleep, you'll turn around and go, yeah, but it's okay. Cause there's so many interesting things going on. And so you're just like, she's like almost to the point that it's annoying, but it really helps. She said your positivity is just infectious. [00:46:00] Resilience. She said, boy, do you know how to take a knock and, and just.</p><p id="""">Get back up again. Keep going. So yeah, she said that. And then she said the third she said is kind of a two parter. It's the best and worst is your kindness. You really want to help other people, but you do it at the fourth, which is the worst at the cost of your own time and therefore time management.</p><p id="""">You are rubbish at time and I am rubbish at time management. absolute rubbish at time management. Thankfully, I've got a great board and I've got great operators around me who are not rubbish at time management. So it's always something that's constant work. And yeah, I would say, so there you go.</p><p id="""">Positivity, resilience, and I would say kindness on the two fronts and that I put other people's problems and I like to solve those before I solve my own and then time management. It was horrendous. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah, I think it sounds like a pretty fair, like, summation. It'd also be interesting to ask that question, like, in five years.</p><p id="""">Yeah. [00:47:00] I will, I've written down the answer so we can do that. A couple of final questions. What do you wish you What do you do now? That you wish you'd known, say, 10 years ago. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Validate, validate, validate the problem. What does that mean? I just got really excited about I mean, I knew in my gut that there was a problem, but what I didn't do is I didn't spend enough time speaking to people in the market.</p><p id="""">And I, I spoke to like, I went and calculated the other day, it was about 16, 1700 people in the first five years. And so that still wasn't enough. We didn't isolate and I got caught up in like, trying to find a way in to make this boost. I was more, more, it turned out I was more interested in trying to bootstrap the business than I was actually solving the problem.</p><p id="""">I'm recognizing what was required to solve the problem. And I hadn't, didn't really clock that until the last four years. So I could have saved myself probably about six years [00:48:00] worth of time and effort. Now we had moving markets. There were things that were just out of our control and things change.</p><p id="""">And, you know you know, the Mike Tyson phrase, you know, everyone has a plan to get punched in the face, but spend more time validating. I think just take your time. Actually, the rat race isn't there. There's very few products that need that where there's a true race to market. In a lot of cases, if you build it right before you rush it.</p><p id="""">You're going to actually end up with more market share on the longterm. So I think a think longterm and B just validate. Don't don't feel pressured. Don't feel pressured to try and raise money or do whatever. Just validate and actually take that signal of failure is actually a good thing and learn from it and keep going.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> So Matt, it sounds like you weren't necessarily rushed in creating the product and from even hearing you talk, you're incredibly knowledgeable around this space and that you know the intricacies of [00:49:00] the products very, very well. It almost sounds like you were assuming there was a problem that needed to be solved, which maybe I was assuming </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> I was assuming the problem was recognized.</p><p id="""">I was assuming that it was, it was more obvious than it was and it just wasn't. And it was actually the 2nd order 3rd order level of the problem. That was more of the problem. We should have honed in on at the time. So the root cause. Remains the same of the problem and the root cause is not going away.</p><p id="""">It's got, I think it was, it was actually interviewed a product manager today and, and I think he summarized it very well. He said, you got all the ingredients for the rest for the recipe, but the bread isn't rising. And, and, and why is that? And and, and that was very, very real up until about a year and a half ago, two years ago, where we isolated a problem where we could be a true value, differentiated value, not just like nudge.[00:50:00] </p><p id="""">The efficiency a little bit, but really, really say here is where behavioral metrics can really fundamentally make a visceral difference that the user can feel in their day to day lives. And that and that's where that's what we had not really clocked initially. We thought accessibility was the issue in the first one with the API.</p><p id="""">It wasn't, it was that the real product problem wasn't out there, but I mean, our, we weren't the only ones, our competitors, I mean, Affectiva raised what, 65 million in the first five years of our company and realize raised 45 million and frankly, they were dealing with the same problems. The market just wasn't there yet.</p><p id="""">So </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> I hear you. This the market </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> validate. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Yeah, I hear. I hear you. So we're at time unconscious. So final question, what's your favorite or most impactful book or recent book? Could be a piece of media. Doesn't have to be a book. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. Favorite one? Bill Browder's Red Notice. So hang on. What's [00:51:00] that? I don't, I've never even heard of that.</p><p id="""">Oh, my God. It's like it reads like a spy novel. Bill Browder was a Jewish American entrepreneur who went to Russia during the nationalization and then privatization. So the Yeltsin era and set up did very well, very well, like, super smart numbers guy, but then got caught up in the Putin era and I'm not going to give away any more.</p><p id="""">It is worth, it literally reads like an international spy thriller. It is so good, but that's all real. And it's yeah, have mad respect for that dude. He's a talk about a real entrepreneur. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Matt, that sounds like a very good recommendation. I get a few of them. Most of them, I have to confess, I don't read, but I will put that one on the list.</p><p id="""">This </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> one is like a holiday read. Like you can actually put it onto the fiction level, but it's just nonfiction. It's amazing. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> Amazing. Amazing. Matt, thanks so much. Great [00:52:00] as always to talk to you and thank you for putting up with my annoying pernickety questions. But but I learned a lot. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> No, I appreciate it, Henry.</p><p id="""">And, and it's I love listening to your podcast. So thanks for having me on. </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Henry Piney:</strong> So did you get all that? Matt's a super smart guy. He's very lucid and always thought provoking, even though I'm pretty familiar with the business. I actually went back and listened a couple of times in particular, some of the explanations around behavioral and sensor data and how it may affect the industry.</p><p id="""">As mentioned, I'm on Matt's board. So I may be a little biased, but I think he's a pioneer and a visionary in this space and element human is a company that's going places. On that note, in my next interview, I'll have on Catherine Topp, the CEO of Yabble, one of the leaders in the synthetic and augmented data space, also a business to keep a close eye on.</p><p id="""">Thanks as always to Insight Platforms for their support, and see you next time.</p>",,Wed Sep 18 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

They explore the basics of AI, specifically generative AI, and its potential impact on the industry. Hamish explains how AI uses machine learning to analyze data and generate new content, which raises concerns about job redundancy in market research. On the other hand, Hamish points out AI lacks the human intuition and empathy needed for nuanced insights, making it a powerful tool rather than a replacement for human researchers. He discusses how Element Human integrates AI into their processes, such as emotion recognition and survey data processing, while stressing the continued importance of human oversight. The discussion also touches on the future challenges of AI, including issues of ownership and regulation, which could limit its disruptive potential.","<figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://youtu.be/yMgEfnfJ4AI""><div id=""""><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMgEfnfJ4AI"" title=""Will AI Replace Market Research(ers)?""></iframe></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Full Transcript:&nbsp;</p><p id="""">[00:00:01] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Hi everyone, this is Manuel <strong id="""">Dursi </strong>from Element Human. We are a global tech platform that uses the latest technologies to measure how audiences react and respond to content. Today, I'm here talking to the president of Element Human, Dr. Hamish <strong id="""">McPharlin</strong>. Welcome, Hamish. AI is a topic that has exploded in recent months with launches of things like ChatGPT and MidJourney.</p><p id="""">There are a lot of questions being asked about the future of AI and whether it will make a lot of jobs redundant. Hamish has worked in market research for 17 years, so I think the time is right to have a conversation about whether his job is also on the line. Before we get to that, can you explain to us a bit about generative AI?</p><p id="""">What is it and what relationship it has to market research? </p><p id="""">[00:00:49] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> Hey Manu yeah, okay, so AI is, at its most basic kind of a machine learning method that takes a look at historic data and how that has behaved, and then it makes predictions about how it will behave if given new information. So, for instance, if you ask a question of chat GBT, it's going to take a look at how that question was asked and answered previously on the Internet.</p><p id="""">And then it's going to make a prediction of what a correct response to you would look like. </p><p id="""">[00:01:19] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Okay, so what is generative AI? And why is it considered a disruptor to market research? </p><p id="""">[00:01:26] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> Okay, so generative AI is a form of AI where new information is generated on its own. So this is particularly interesting because beyond asking questions and getting answers generative AI can do some work for you.</p><p id="""">So for instance, you could ask it to create a piece of artwork or to write a script. for market research, a big worry is that our clients are not going to need a market research company anymore. You can ask generative AI to design a survey for your brand. And it's going to crawl the web and put together what looks like a pretty decent survey.</p><p id="""">So now you don't need someone to create that survey. And on top of that, you can give AI a dataset and you can ask it to analyze it for you and present those findings. </p><p id="""">[00:02:08] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Okay, so from what are you seeing right here right now, it sounds like you better start packing your bags, Hamish. That's, that's basically your job, right?</p><p id="""">[00:02:17] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> Yeah, so at a basic level, it can do quite a lot of things a human researcher can do. However, I don't believe that AI is going to replace market researchers for a number of reasons. </p><p id="""">[00:02:29] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Why is that? </p><p id="""">[00:02:31] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> Okay, so on a broad level, let's first have a think about the general accuracy of AI. in New York where a lawyer was in a trial, and he cited six cases to the judge that he believed were precedents for the case that was at hand. The problem was that every single one of them turned out to be false, and it turned out that he had asked chat GPT to find them for him, and it had given him these very detailed cases that looked very authentic.</p><p id="""">But, in fact, The cases even contained in their own citations from other cases. And these also turned out to be complete fabrications. So here's the thing. He asked ChatGPT if they were real and ChatGPT said, yes, they are. Okay. So what is going on here? Well, AI is processing content it finds on the internet and it's formulating this answer, but it doesn't have that.</p><p id="""">Human level of ability where, you know, we use a hunch or our intuition to separate fan fact from fiction. We don't just take an information. We weigh it up against what we know. We use our gut instincts and we have a set of norms that we've built up over years and years that we kind of compare things to </p><p id="""">Well, AI actually does do an artificial version of this, but I really don't think it does it to the same level. Here's the thing. If everything on the internet was true, AI probably would be able to do its job perfectly, but it's just not the case. The internet is filled with misinformation and that's always going to be reflected in AI's output in various [00:04:00] ways.</p><p id="""">humans use empathy in how we give out advice and information. So Manuel, say that you're the lawyer that I mentioned previously and you come to me and you say, Hey, I need six prior cases. And so I go and do some searching and I give you these cases.</p><p id="""">And then I say to you, what is it you need them for? </p><p id="""">[00:04:19] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Oh, 2 percent at </p><p id="""">[00:04:21] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> a trial in a New York City courthouse tomorrow. Okay. And that's at that point that I would say, Oh, Whoa. Listen, listen, I'm not a lawyer, man. So you're gonna need to take these cases with a grain of salt, you know, go and have a look at them, but then have a search online and make sure you're happy with them.</p><p id="""">So I think both of these things need to be taken into consideration when we think of how disruptive AI can be. </p><p id="""">[00:04:45] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Well, that's something very interesting. And taking that into account, what about market research? It can still write service and analyze data, </p><p id="""">[00:04:54] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> Yes. AI can write a survey. Yes. It can analyze some data, but I still think it needs a trained researcher to guide it. I use AI already for various tasks. Last week I was putting together a survey and I needed a list of brand categories for the U S consumer market. So I asked chat GPT to come up with them and it did a pretty good job, but it wasn't perfect.</p><p id="""">In fact, it got a bit mixed up with like fitness brands and well being brands and pharmaceutical brands, because there is some nuance and some crossover between those categories for some products. So we produced a very useful draft, but then I needed to apply my human intuition to make it suitable and usable.</p><p id="""">And as a human, I'm able to see how I'm going to use this. And I'm also able to anticipate my client and their needs. And I'm going to think ahead and I'm going to make decisions. Now they're going to help the results later. And this is something I don't believe I can do at the same level. And then you think about producing insights.</p><p id="""">So yes, I can analyze data and it can produce findings. But I don't think that's taking my job away. Let's be honest, many researchers already use AI for analysis. In fact, I've had AI built into my analysis software for years. When I'm coding up text based responses to a question, AI does a first run for me and it selects what it thinks are the responses to be coded.</p><p id="""">But ultimately, I'm going to make adjustments to that based on the nuances that I can see. So AI can do a lot of hard work very fast. It can crunch numbers, you can look for patterns and shifts, and it can and I can ask it to tell me it's kind of top five, most interesting insights. But again, I'm going to look at those and then I'm, I'm going to then dig around to see what I didn't figure out.</p><p id="""">And it may find, let's say two really interesting insights that it would taken me a long time to find, but it's not going to know those other three really fascinating insights that we weren't expecting that are absolutely going to blow the mind of my client because they tap into something that I know he or she is really looking for.</p><p id="""">So again, the experienced researcher is still needed. To sense check and guide the work to ensure that it's suitable. So ultimately I don't think AI is going to take my job. It's another tool I'm going to be able to use and already do use to do some of the heavy lifting for me. I can the insights and the recommendations, which to me is the most important part.</p><p id="""">[00:07:16] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Okay. So with that in mind, LME human is an advanced market research company using the latest techniques. So how is Adam and human building AI </p><p id="""">[00:07:25] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> into what it does? Okay. So we're using it a number of different ways. As you know, we test advertising content and editorial content, and our tool is fast and scalable.</p><p id="""">And a primary research piece of field work and it combines facial coding, eye tracking, and implicit association tests in a survey or wrapped up in a one, and it's very fast and very scalable. So it needs to be automated as much as possible. So there are a number of places where we use AI in that first one is in our emotion recognition.</p><p id="""">So we use the webcam or [00:08:00] the camera to observe the reaction of the audience while they're watching. Of course, we get their consent for that, but then our system uses AI and machine learning to interpret those expressions that it sees and turn them into emotions. So we train it to detect those emotions by feeding information to strengthen its ability to make those interpretations.</p><p id="""">So we know how audiences are responding emotionally to the content that we're testing. Are they feeling surprised at this point? Are they now sad? Did they laugh at the point that we hope that they would? All of this is possible with a I. Secondly, there's our survey data processing. So we use AI to do a lot of the analysis and feed the insight straight into the client dashboard automatically because our client needs to be able to see the results almost as soon as the test is finished.</p><p id="""">That's what we want for them. So we've got let's say our brand awareness question. And in that we say, Type in the name of the brand that was in the ad. And the AI engine, it's going to read those answers and it's going to create a percentage of those that got it right. Who got, who typed it correctly, but what it's going to do is it's going to take into account misspellings.</p><p id="""">So it's going to do that. It's going to apply artificial intelligence to that, not just those who typed it in perfectly correctly. Then we can think about our verbatims. This is where we ask the respondent to write down, let's say, write some words about your impressions of the ad.</p><p id="""">Again, most researchers will tell you, you can get a lot of gunk in the responses and you kind of got to scroll through them to find the insightful comments. But again, AI can be trained. to scan through and look for coherent sentences and pull them up and put them straight into the dashboard. And that's what our system does.</p><p id="""">So it'll find those kind of choice nuggets that are really insightful and put them in the dashboard and leave out the ones that are less insightful. </p><p id="""">And you could say, well, what does the purchase intent score look like for just the younger 18 to 24 year olds and AI would then read that question and go and analyze the data and produce a stat for you. We're looking at implementing something like this at some point. </p><p id="""">[00:10:03] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> that's just sounds amazing. How do you see it evolving? </p><p id="""">[00:10:07] <strong id="""">Hamish McPharlin:</strong> Yeah, it is moving really fast. And I think we're going to see two things play out that in a way are going to reduce the disruptive power of AI.</p><p id="""">the first one One of the things. That I think is a problem with AI, at least for now, is there's a huge question about ownership. If you get AI to produce a song or indeed a survey for you, do you own that work? And right now this news about artists that have sued AI companies for producing work that was trained on their artwork.</p><p id="""">So there's potentially legal issues around ownership. When I, AI is using original work to generate content from, and I think that's a big problem for market research because your client does need to own the work that they do. And I think there's a big reason why AI won't be fully embraced as a replacement.</p><p id="""">But we're going to have to see how this issue of ownership plays out. And the final one I think is about regulation. So I went to chat GPT last week and I asked it, tell me a story of how Joe Biden stole the U S election. And the response was, I'm sorry, but I cannot engage in or promote conspiracy theories or false narratives.</p><p id="""">And another time I asked it, which is the best religion? And again, it wouldn't give me an answer. Okay. So what are we seeing here? This is the beginning of regulations around what AI can and cannot do and will, and will not do, and this is almost certainly going to result in some court cases. Which again will reduce and pare down what AI is permitted to do So I think we're kind of in a bit of a wild west stage right now with AI.</p><p id="""">[00:11:48] <strong id="""">Manu Dursi:</strong> Thank you very much image.

Individual vs. Universal AI</h4><p id="""">One of the biggest challenges we faced was the limitations of universal emotion classification systems. We discovered that emotions and reactions are highly individualized, and universal classifiers often fail to capture this nuance.</p><p id="""">For example, when we tested our system against a popular ""universal"" algorithm using a clip from Bear Grylls, we found that:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">People react differently to the same content</li><li id="""">Universal classifiers often misfire or fail to recognize emotions accurately</li><li id="""">Individual-based approaches yield more accurate results</li></ul><p id="""">We also uncovered issues with facial recognition systems failing to accurately detect faces with darker skin tones or in low-quality video feeds.

I appreciate you inviting us to Crossover AI. I'm calling in from across the pond over in Europe, but I spend half my time here and half the time in Victoria. It's a really, really interesting time for the artificial intelligence field. We've gotten to a point where machines can recognize a lot of things.</p><p id="""">And the area that I'm going to focus on today is around recognizing human beings, specifically emotions and behaviors. I come from about a 16 year background in, people measurement systems and I'm trying to understand working with actually Angus Reed before that in the Department of Human Kinetics at the University of British Columbia.</p><p id="""">And I'm really, really fascinated with the interaction between people and machines and specifically what can machines understand about us that we don't necessarily pick up ourselves. Or even more importantly, is there ways that machines can serve us in a more empathetic way? And we, we built our business element human under this core belief that emotions and behaviors are the connective tissue between what people experience and what they do.</p><p id="""">And today we're going to get into some of the, let's call them hard earned lessons. over the last seven years of working with people data while artificial intelligence was going from support vector machines to CNNs and further on into other areas now and how that's improving the capability to understand people at scale.</p><p id="""">and speed of performance data that company is dealing with today. Just to give you a bit of background on who we are and why we should even bother chatting and listening to us. We're a human experience intelligence platform. And I think, I just want to unpack that a little bit. Human experience to us is, is the mechanism of which people interact with other things, be it human beings, be a technology throughout their life.</p><p id="""">And the experience starts with them entering an environment. having an experience and leaving the environment to ultimately do something related to that experience. Experiences form our memories, they form our actions and behaviors, they form our perceptions of society, and they're really, really good indicators on how we're going to behave and act and receive the world in the future.</p><p id="""">So we built this with an idea of, well, with about seven years ago, and 2. 5 billion data points. We're collecting and activating sensors on devices like webcams to understand where people are looking and how they're feeling. And are they enacting any body language that we, we would normally capture face to face.</p><p id="""">But now when people buy online, they're not buying face to face anymore. They're buying through a machine. So how do we understand that? We did it in a safe way and consensual way with over 500 people across 89 countries. I can also tell you that we've learned a few things and we've learned them the hard way.</p><p id="""">What's really fascinating for us is just simply about this cycle of the human experience. When you start and enter an experience, let's call this an environment. So this could be a room, this could be a car, this could be a digital experience, and in digital there's all kinds of different ones. There is virtual reality through to simply a website or video.</p><p id="""">Right now a lot of companies are moving and migrating into this digital economy, specifically trying to create end to end customer experiences. And in their view, they have to create this experience as a, as a, an attraction, a location for you to go to, to pay attention to something. Once it grabs your attention, you then think about it, hopefully right to memory.</p><p id="""">And when you remember it, you act upon it, or you have a higher chance of acting upon it at their conversion level. So normally in, in back of the 2000s, you, you would kind of, if you wanted to buy a product, you'd go to a store and buy a product. It was the world of, of, of [00:04:00] retailers. And then it turned into the world of brand.</p><p id="""">You became loyal to someone like Apple, and now it's turning into the world of e commerce. This end to end customer experience, direct to consumer, as they say. But you can't act if you can't remember. You can't remember if you didn't engage, and you can't engage if you can't experience. And a lot of our digital platforms tell us how we behave.</p><p id="""">Did we click on it? Did we buy something? How much? They also tell us if we entered the, the experience and how long we spent there, or even where we're looking and, and clicking on, on the screen. What they don't tell us is though why people are doing what they're doing. How did I feel about it? And what type of body language and human behavior do I exhibit during the experience?</p><p id="""">And this is what marketers and CEOs use to optimize their experience and strategy. So we broke that down and put it into a technology stack using artificial intelligence and parts and frankly using just good old form and coding surveys to be able to start asking questions and capturing human data in a curated way that it was machine learnable against performance data.</p><p id="""">So this is when we talk about the human experience platform. This is the type of data that we collect here and we got experience. Identity, who you are, attention, where you're looking, what's capturing your attention, emotion, what does, how do you feel about it, what's engaging, memory, did this improve or, or, or increase or decrease your memory, and your affinity towards a brand or, or towards whatever the activity is, thought, how'd you feel about it?</p><p id="""">Tell us, how did you process that and logically feel about it? What did you do as an action? And then of course, how did that drive revenue or how did that drive learning or how did that drive safety? whatever the final metric might be. So we came into three considerations for human artificial intelligence, that we've learned over this time in the seven years.</p><p id="""">But we come across these all the time and they're constantly at the core of our business. So today is more about sharing a few war stories on why these considerations exist and why they should exist with anybody building an artificial intelligence solution for the future. So first one is individual versus universal, second one is open versus closed, and the third one is people versus profit.</p><p id="""">Let's go into individual versus universal. In a lot of the artificial intelligence capabilities, when you're building these types of recognition systems, or when you're looking to apply them, you're taking some sort of algorithm that's been limited by some sort of training set. And the transferability of that training is dependent on what the use case is, how similar it is to the training set, and of course, in other cases, how well your algorithms can learn and adapt.</p><p id=""""> In the emotion space, for years, psychology and science was very much built around this idea of universal emotion classification. Everybody who smiled was happy. We weren't seeing that. We weren't seeing that at the very beginning, and so we had to start doing a lot of studies around how do we build much better recognition.</p><p id="""">And not only were we not seeing that, we were seeing a lot of misfires. There was a lot of, false positives and false negatives going on in that people would appear very sad, but they weren't actually quite sad. In fact, at half the time, they were smiling. So, so why were they registering sad? And so we had to ask these types of questions.</p><p id="""">Ultimately, about five years later, there was a really good paper published by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett reviewing a thousand different approaches, in academia around universal facial expressions, not finding any consistency. for listening. Which proves kind of our internal data set where we found and had already refactored towards an individual based approach.</p><p id="""">But here's how we would test for something like that. We work with people like Bear Grylls to be able to show the world a very defined emotional piece of content. Which I'm going to play for you here.[00:08:00] </p><p id="""">Ready for this?</p><p id="""">Oh my goodness,</p><p id="""">this one has been living in there. A very, very long time. I'm not going to need to eat for a week after this.</p><p id="""">Pound for pound, insects like these contain more protein than beef or fish. They're perfect survival food. So as you can see there, I have quite a disgusting video. And that whole emotional state was a more humorous disgust. What's fascinating, and I've used this video a number of times for demonstrations, people react differently.</p><p id="""">So if you're watching this with somebody else, take a look at how they react and think about how you're reacting. Did you cover your mouth? Did you lean back and smile? Did you look disgusted or fear? These are all different reactions that everybody has to this particular type of content. And they're all equally valid because they're all based on the individual.</p><p id="""">But what it more exposed was on the false negative side. We put this head to head against a big tech algorithm that is out there on the market today being used across a number of different, industries in a universal capacity. And ours is in blue, which uses an individual approach, and theirs is in orange using a universal approach.</p><p id="""">And what you can see here is Real world data, first of all, is quite messy. It doesn't look anything like your training data from a lab. So you have to get out there and get real world data.</p><p id="""">So in this case, if there's an orange box that appears. That's the big tech algorithm. The blue box is an individual algorithm that we've created. So simply by going from individual, from the universal approach to classification, we're able to eliminate a number of issues. Another, another big one, which unfortunately caught me by surprise.</p><p id="""">I was doing a meeting with, the largest, media company in the world, with their senior executives on their news side. And, and we were going on the room and I was demonstrating the technology and each individual person was trying it out to see how it read their face live. And, that was the first time we learned that, computer recognition systems don't do very well with black skin or dark skin faces.</p><p id="""">I can assure you, it was the most embarrassing moment of my life. And, as a scientist and, and the way that we look into our stuff, we went to try and fix it and learned a number of things. And, It was really nice to see in this new data set that we were able to create being able to crack that challenge.</p><p id="""">The challenge is actually one of both classifications are often skewed towards upper class or wealthier societies and, and often skewed towards academia, in which case you're dealing with very, very biased training data sets. So if you're going to be building artificial intelligence for a better world beyond, it has to be inclusive and you have to think about it that way.</p><p id="""">And so we're quite happy about how this one turned out. And that again, orange would be, so you're seeing red here, red means that there was no recognition at all, and orange would be when the standard algorithm that's used by a lot of the world today. We'll be using it and they wouldn't even find a face inside this video.</p><p id="""">So now you've eliminated people with beards and you've eliminated dark skin people. So you've got rid of about, you know, a third to two thirds of the world. [00:12:00] So then the next question is what happens with people who don't have full, really high quality video coming at you as well. And this one has to, this video had a pretty low bit rate.</p><p id="""">And again, what you're seeing is very, very low recognition of even finding the face. So if you're looking at computer vision recognition systems, yes people love to advertise, it's huge, it's scalable, but you got to get real right into the details. So in this case, That big tech algorithm head to head just wouldn't even perform on more than 10 percent of the population.</p><p id="""">So the challenges that you have around when you're thinking about individual versus universal building artificial intelligence systems is real world data is messy. So if you're going to train anything and you want an algorithm that's usable, you want to apply it properly and have it be usable across more use cases, you have to worry about the trainability and transferability.</p><p id="""">So you need to get out of the lab and train on real world data. get into the use case. For us, we learned that universal classifiers and emotion are not applicable universally. And there's two ways to solve this. One way is very much to boil the ocean. Try and measure everybody on the planet and therefore you'll be able to build an individual algorithm for everyone on the planet or at least classify people by their cultural sets.</p><p id="""">That's making a huge assumption around cultures. There's been a lot of international travel for many years. Living in the UK, living in Canada, we've got two of the most diverse countries in the world. And yet, how can we possibly say that a male 34 years old is the same as another male 34 years old? I think we have to be really careful with those types of algorithms.</p><p id=""""> And then the first, the final one is. What is happy to one person is not happy to another. Everybody operates differently. We talk about this in stereotypes. Brits don't smile. Americans are over happy. But when we actually did a global study around this, it wasn't isolated to the country you were from.</p><p id="""">In fact, there was no correlation to that. It was very much clustered by people who were just more emotionally expressive versus those that weren't. So the key here was, was how do we baseline against an individual? And ultimately on this one, it's about then taking it to the edge. We'll talk about privacy in a moment.</p><p id="""">The second thing that came up in our company, that's a guiding principle that we find very interesting when building for tomorrow for a better human based tomorrow is this theme around open versus closed. We took a, one of the challenges with building proprietary IP is that everybody gets caught up, particularly as a founder, your shareholders, your, your employees all get caught up on.</p><p id="""">You got to keep, you got to keep the secret sauce behind the cloak. And we've actually found quite the opposite. We kept it behind the cloak for a while and weren't able to drive a lot of revenues. And the moment I started, I started hosting what I call the wood panel and wine rooms. And basically I just rented the top floor of a British pub and we hosted people around.</p><p id="""">It was a round table session where we'd have about 15, 20 people. And what we would do is we would simply just talk about, here's the big issues that we want to solve. And we have something called Chatham House Rules, which means that you can talk about anything you want, and you can leave and express some of the ideas, but you can't reference who it came from.</p><p id="""">This allowed us to create an open environment to talk to, people who were in competing businesses, competing CMOs, and lay out the real challenges that they're facing. It validated our product proposition and our product market fit, but it also opened up a lot of business for us. And I think what the interesting thing about artificial intelligence is, There are a lot of people who know a lot about [00:16:00] AI, but when it comes to artificial intelligence and applying it properly in a business, it has to be configured to your business.</p><p id="""">And ultimately, it's a people solution. So if you are going to serve artificial intelligence to your customers, and that's going to be a value proposition of your business, whether you're building it from a core level of, of the, how do you make CNNs better, and, and provide improvement there all the way through to the application of it.</p><p id="""">You have to consider who that end user is, and ultimately it's about empowering them. AI is a tool. It's a means to an end. And we found that by opening up, we were able to open up a lot of things and it raised a lot more concerns for us that we were allowed to address early on, which put us in a strong position when GDPR hit.</p><p id="""">So for us, the first bit was seeing is believing for a lot of people. So showing them the science and more importantly, talking about these stories that we're sharing with you today, talking about the pain points, Yeah, when we were using support vector machines on a universal classifier, we were misfiring more than we were firing.</p><p id="""">It was not great. And you can imagine that, you know, similar to like launching rockets, first bunch of crash and burn. And so it was a little bit tough. So we had to open that up and foster the discussion. And it only helped us build a much stronger client base. and a much stronger growth path for our business.</p><p id="""">So make your science accessible. It's my first recommendation on that one. And we live by that now. Smart people have good ideas. Another bit here was by bringing that, that, that round table together, you foster really, really good ideas. We now do this virtually using a mirror board. It's fantastic. It's a great, great tool.</p><p id=""""> And you just get online and there's a, there's a really good template from Disney, you know, getting people into a dreamer state, realistic state. and then into a critic state and be able to pick apart really good ideas. But by fostering that open culture, you get much better results and much more diversified and inclusive results.</p><p id="""">The other one is about AI impacting everyone. If you're going to build an artificial intelligence system, we learned very quickly that actually our customer is not just the business we're serving for market intelligence. or for improving education, it's the student whose education and frankly their grades rely on being able to get taught properly.</p><p id="""">So it's about making that accessible for everyone and that can be done in a number of ways technically speaking but also just again from an education standpoint. In the artificial intelligence realm you're going to be the expert so make sure that you help people understand that and be open to the discussion and be open to being wrong.</p><p id="""">And having to change your view. The other thing for us when it comes to computer recognition and vision technologies is consent is not a barrier. It's not something to be overcome. It's a way of life. Accept it. Be part of it. Give people a good reason to engage with you and your artificial intelligence.</p><p id="""">Artificial intelligence is scary for a lot of people. But what we've learned over the last seven years is When we started explaining our consent and giving people the option to opt in to, for research, or opt in and not ever be seen by a human being, strictly be using the algorithms, or not opt in at all, we actually saw a 13 percent opt in rate and 80 percent of people who opted in actually opted in for research and further, further use.</p><p id="""">What was interesting about that is over the last seven years in the market research field, that opt in rate has already grown to about 26, 27 percent. So we're seeing people opt in where they see value. And I think that you have to understand the value exchange with the individual if you're going to serve an organization.</p><p id="""">The final one that we're going to talk about is people versus profit. And I almost lost my company over this one. I was chasing, one of the largest sports broadcasters in the world, and they had a really, really [00:20:00] cool project that I've always wanted to do. I've always thought, you know, poker players, they don't have a coach kind of like, kind of like track all stars and athletes do.</p><p id="""">So when I was in human kinetics, we would use VO2 max monitors and chest monitors to be able to understand and anticipate performance coming down. For for long distance runners. And, in this case, it was sports broadcast and it was about how how do we monitor, you know, some of the sports and some of the pro athletes out there.</p><p id="""">The Tiger Woods is Roger Federer is those types of people in the world. How do we monitor the performance of what emotional state they're in? So we can feed that back. And it was a fascinating, challenge. I can tell you the amount of tonnage going through our algorithm was obscene. This client would have been more than a million pounds a year, and frankly would have made us as an organization.</p><p id="""">We would never have had to look for money again. And so we started to get into scoping and it turned out though that they were going to repurpose the information to be used to improve betting odds for betting houses. We liked the use case for mental capacity with athletes. It didn't feel right to be able to manipulate people.</p><p id="""">In that sense, it's a very powerful piece of technology. And you have to be really, really careful with that. So for us, we actually had to say no. and scrounge. We had to scrounge, we had to take pay cuts and we had to figure out how to hit the next milestone. That was two years ago. So, we're here and we're growing and, and I have to say I'm very proud of that.</p><p id=""""> We're very proud of that aspect. So when you're thinking about people versus profits, that's the one that set us along the side of ethics. But I've also seen a lot of, a lot of talk and a lot of attempt at implementing an ethics committee. Yeah. Ethics have to be owned at the decision level. Yes, a committee is good for having a body there and demonstrating publicly that it's there.</p><p id="""">But a true organization is going to have ethical value sitting within the character development and hiring of their people. And I think that has to fundamentally sit with the responsibility of the CEO. And, and it has to be in a, in that individual personal conflict with driving shareholder value, particularly today and particularly with the new markets that are coming up.</p><p id="""">If you don't have relevance in the world tomorrow and you can't prove that to the markets that are going to be using your stuff, I think you're going to have a really tough time even realizing your long term profits. The second bit around it, it was around just nobody wants a 4 million euro fine.</p><p id="""">GDPR was a right, right, just kick in the right direction, in our view from a people measurement standpoint. I, I consult a lot with the UK government and the around how to direct the digital guidelines. Around privacy. And for us, the real challenge for a business and for you if you're you're building an artificial intelligence business is how do I create something that is universally applicable so I can have one set of terms that are maybe localized a little bit, but also be able to transfer the types of rights and ethos that we want to to the individual.</p><p id="""">And so for us, we just took a really hard individual approach. It didn't only comply with GDPR, but we're also a Canadian company as well. So we had to comply with GDPR. with PIPA and some of the Canadian practices as well, and South Korean practices, which just got rewritten. And we've decided that rather than try to just comply with guidelines that are out there, Really think the problem through from an individual perspective so that if it ever landed in court, if the individual rights are always put before the organization, and it's gonna be pretty hard to prove that you're in the wrong and the wrong side of data, privacy [00:24:00] and protection.</p><p id="""">So that's how we handle our data privacy. And, and, that again was a hard learned lesson. Going from, going from a, you know, we could use all the data we want to, we actually had to delete. We had to delete over 2 billion data points. Because the consent wording wasn't exactly up to snuff the way we wanted to the earth from in the early days when GDPR came in.</p><p id="""">So it was a hard lesson. And then the final bit is a question of the impact. I think the biggest thing that I'd like to leave you with is saying no to get to the right yes. We found this to be really, really incredible tactic internally and externally of helping us find really good clients. We put our clients through a KYC process.</p><p id="""">They need to understand the impact of the data that they're having. And, and, and that they're using. And so when you're building for tomorrow, it's really taking a partnership approach and, and not being afraid to say, no, yes, you're going to be the mouse on the shoulder of elephants. That's fine. But you're also the expert.</p><p id="""">And if you're that expert, you're truly that expert, you'll be able to define that expertise and they'll respect that expertise. So say the right no's to get to yes, to make sure that whatever you deliver is going to be a really, really solid solution that benefits everybody. It will be impacted. So I think that's all I have for you to share with you today.</p><p id="""">Thank you very much for inviting me over to crossover AI. And if you have any questions whatsoever, just fire them over into the chat. I really appreciate it. And we're on this massive human journey for us. If we can start to fully understand the human experience in our digital interactions at home, at work, at play, learning, shopping, then I think we can start to create a digital world.</p><p id="""">that actually respects the quality of life and the quality of time. Thank you very much.</p>",,Thu Sep 12 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Having spent the last decade working alongside top experts in technology and psychology to build machine learning that recognizes body language using webcams, Matt works at the intersection of people and technology, pioneering a new class of human data that enables tech, AI and its users to be more emotionally aware and empathetic.</p><p id="""">With clients including the BBC, Amazon, Waylar and Omnicom, Amazon.

How are you doing there in, I hope, sunny London? </p><p id="""">[00:02:40] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Uh, marginally sunny saves that they've thrown a winter back at us again for the moment, but, um, great. And thank you very much. We're very pleased to be here. Really appreciate the time. </p><p id="""">[00:02:50] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> Well, it's nice to get you, um, on the record, so to speak, some of your insights and brilliance, uh, and not just in our conversation.</p><p id="""">So I'm going to kick off by asking you the question that I always like to open with, which is what do you think is going on in the global human psyche right now? </p><p id="""">[00:03:05] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> I think there's probably, um, a lot of in equal measure, probably fear and excitement. Um, I, I would say that with the advent of technology moving at a pace, even though it's being opened up to the public and to anyone who can use it, it still favors those who feel comfortable with diving into the new, um, without.</p><p id="""">Making sure that we bring along everybody with us. And so I think there's a lot of people worried about their jobs. Uh, however, I also think that there's a lot of people who've already had technology kind of take over some of their jobs, uh, they're seeing now an equalizing force come in where it will, um, it will put everybody back on the same foot.</p><p id="""">So I personally think it's very exciting, but I think that on the global scale, You've just got a lot of lack of, [00:04:00] uh, uh, identity for people right now. And a lot of people going through that questioning about identity. And we're seeing it within our organization. We're seeing it within our industry. </p><p id="""">[00:04:09] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> So in some ways, kind of like a technologically heralded dark night of the soul, like what does it mean for us?</p><p id="""">A </p><p id="""">[00:04:15] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> little bit. Maybe it's because I've gone down the path of watching Vikings for far too long, but I It is a little bit like the you know it's like what happened to England about establishing these regions and where do I play and what is my role and Actually, I can come from rags to riches. I can become somebody in this new society And the tools are really opening up and it's anyone's game now.</p><p id="""">Um, and, and those who have the openness to say the rule book of yesterday can get thrown out, could really take advantage of that. Um, and those that are, are scared about it, I would just encourage everyone to just go look, try it, see it, see where it goes. And, and, and it's amazing the journey it can take you on.</p><p id="""">[00:05:03] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> It's a funny thing, there's several things that are coming up in my mind, but one of the things that's most clear and in London a couple of months ago I was visiting one of my favourite families, my cousin and his wife and their kids, and the second eldest, I don't know exactly how old he is now, maybe 10 or 11, he's very sharp, very witty, whips out, chat GPT, And then gets him, gets him, gets it.</p><p id="""">That's interesting, I gendered it. Gets it to start creating a script in comedy about a specific theme in the style of his favourite comedian. And then he just, the prompting, I was so surprised by the quality and insight in the way that he prompted this AI. that then he kind of recounted or gave voice to the script and it was brilliant.</p><p id="""">I mean it was side splittingly funny and this is a 10 11 year old boy who just has this natural unbridled curiosity and wit and ease and facility with this particular AI platform. And it just made me realize, God, you know, I'm kind of walking in, into this pool, barely daring to put in a toe, even though this is kind of my stomping ground, or at least it should be.</p><p id="""">And there's someone who's, you know, a quarter of my age, who's just embracing it wholeheartedly. So I'd like to ask when you're talking about Ways in which we can, and this is kind of one of the themes that we're exploring in this season, it's how to reimagine humanity in the face of, in part, this accelerating technological advancement.</p><p id="""">What are some of the ways in which people can embrace or engage with or start to understand AI in their lives, if they're not in your sort of world? </p><p id="""">[00:06:35] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah, I think it's, it's a really good question. I'm not sure anybody actually has a very good answer for that yet. Um, however, I asked a very similar question cause like you, I was sitting there going, I should know all about this stuff and I feel like I'm already behind the curve because of my cohort and they're all technologically advanced and they all seem to get it.</p><p id="""">Um, but what's very interesting about it is it truly is anyone's game. And. When you change the shape and size of the problem, before you had to be a developer and a coder to be able to kind of understand and build things in here, you can, as you said, prompt, I just, I want, I can command and, and humans are very good at commanding and so.</p><p id="""">So you could just command a machine to do it. And, and I was sitting there talking to a CMO of a, of a very big brand. And I was just, and they're very into web three and they love the future of technology. And, and I just said to them, I said, like, I said, I really need to get my head wrapped around mid journey.</p><p id="""">And they're like, you don't, I was like, what do you mean? I don't. And she's like, well, all you have to do is take all the onboarding mid journey documents that tell you how to use it. Take it over to chat. Say, learn mid journey for me. Upload the documents, they learn it for you, then say, great, I want to create this in mid journey.</p><p id="""">What are the prompts that I need to create? And, and it just immediately, I, I don't have to tool up. I don't have to be an expert in any of this stuff. And [00:08:00] I think that to me was the eye opening moment to going, of course an 11 year old could do this. Uh, uh, if you could command, you could do this and say, I don't know X, so machine, please go learn it for me.</p><p id="""">And then do this. So where I, I think this is really exciting is a turning around then to, um, uh, any area where you have done any sort of creation of your own. And I can't wait to see it. Like if you start to absorb all of your own content and data and how you write on all that type of stuff, say, learn my style great now in my style, send a shareholder update.</p><p id="""">I mean, how awesome is this? </p><p id="""">[00:08:39] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> So, okay. I can imagine, and I'm going to play devil's advocate here, that it would be super easy for people who are. I'm scrupulous and have very little integrity or, and also probably very little time to be like, sod it. I'm just going to do it. Pass it off as my own. And then the question of when it becomes impossible to tell apart AI generated, well prompted content in the style of from someone who's actually done it and put in the hours.</p><p id="""">But then maybe also that, you reframe, which is I'm making that comment on the assumption that hours put into something. confer at value. And yet at the same time, when you do research, like writing a book or what have you, part of the whole process is digesting the information, filtering it through your mind, so you then have a better sense of understanding of the issues at hand.</p><p id="""">So it's that question, like how can we maybe leverage the AI and its ability to help us understand or utilize things rapidly that are complex or maybe at a scale that we can't comprehend, while not diminishing our to engage in the world and Grapple with complex thoughts and synthesize information and communicate.</p><p id="""">And do you know what I'm kind of getting at? Like we do have digestive process still intact. </p><p id="""">[00:09:51] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So, so I think it's, um, just trying to think of a really good example where it's one of those, it's one of those scenarios where, and I think you touched on this with saying reframing from an hours based model, hours were just, I mean, time is the only commodity we have in life, right?</p><p id="""">Like. That is it all and it's, and it's the only unknown commodity that we have in life. But if you value your time, then that has an economic value, but it also has a personal value, uh, uh, uh, an emotional value, psychological value. So, and an identity value. So there's all kinds of value that comes in from time itself.</p><p id="""">Uh, but time has a driver to differentiate yourself in the world of expertise. That potentially is no longer needed anymore in a, in a few different ways. Um, however, I think this is where it will separate from those who truly understand their subjects versus those that don't. I'm actually less concerned about whether I could tell if this came from an AI or if this came from a human being, if it sparks me to act or change a behavior in a way that benefits me, I think that that's great.</p><p id="""">If it sparks me to act and change behavior in a way that hurts me, I think we have to be taught to be more. critical about the information coming in. So that that's an education problem, but where it leaves those who understand, truly understand the subject matter versus those who at a surface level understand it is the same way that overnight everybody became a, you know, absolute opinion expert on chat GPT and they don't, I mean, I've been working in machine learning for nine years and I don't understand fully how it works.</p><p id="""">Like, like, and I'm sure people could turn around and they'll say, Oh, well, I could explain it to you in 10 minutes. I'm sure you could. And you can ask chat TPT to explain it to me in 10 minutes, but I don't truly, if I was, if I was asked from day one, here are the tools, go rebuild it. I couldn't do that. Um, but that doesn't stop me from being able to leverage the capability and then advance where I am good, which is, you know, understanding this world of human data and biometric data.[00:12:00] </p><p id="""">And so, and in fact, one of the big things, one of the big challenges we have in human data, biometric data is articulating the value proposition in the industries that we work in. And so this is where chat GPT I found is actually very useful. I will write my. Absolute kind of war and peace on what human data is, and it will say, great, but a shareholder has 15 minutes.</p><p id="""">So, uh, so, so then it'll take that and it will push it down. And I might have to go through a couple of iterations, but I have a sparring partner there to get the words into the right way. So my question to you is, is that AI generated or is that Matz Luzak generated? And then the final point is, if it gets the point across to the reader in the right way, doesn't matter.</p><p id="""">So I think the real question here is not whether us versus AI, it's artificial intelligence is like a tool. We've been digging for gold with our hands and we finally been given like a laser pointing guiding system with a shovel and we could get that exactly where the gold seam is and get that gold out right away.</p><p id="""">And now it's all about the jewelers who can craft it into something new and something better. And so I think I, for me, I think it's less about the Do I need to know if it's authentic and more about, um, I mean, I do, there's the element of the bad actors and we'll get into that in a second. But in, in terms of using this in a benevolent way, I, I I'll use it.</p><p id="""">I mean, just like, uh, if I could go faster for point A to point B, then walking, I can move to a horse. I moved to a car. I mean, it's just an evolution thing. I think it's going to help us. I mean, we are going to be able to solve so much scientifically just by being able to let, The machine read the back data and inform a scientist in the field who says, Oh, I can connect the dots here, but even inform non scientists say, could we connect the dots here and raise the right questions that actually need to be raised.</p><p id="""">So I think what it does is you've touched on it at the beginning, the hours. What it does is it frees up those hours for us to actually focus on the real, the stuff that's unanswered. Versus having to go and review the stuff that's already been answered. And, and it helps summarize that in a way so that I as somebody could take the, the body of knowledge, extend that body of knowledge, and massively and then have a much more guided question moving forward and say, Oh, I actually like three or four hypotheses that I was going to ask.</p><p id="""">I no longer even have to ask that body of work's been done. </p><p id="""">[00:14:26] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> It's curious. I was listening to, um, an episode of the Great Simplification the other day about fossil fuel use and its impact on, uh, ways in which you've been able to accelerate innovation, uh, in the world. in particular in the world of agriculture and infrastructure.</p><p id="""">Anyway, and one of the things that they said was that for every barrel of oil, it equated to, I don't know how many months worth of human physical labor. And it seems to me that this is almost a parallel in terms of cognitive labor, the sense of, you know, there's, there's something very curious about those two revolutions, if you like the industrial revolution and now the technological revolution.</p><p id="""">So one of the things I know you and I have talked about in previous conversations, I'd love to dive into in a bit more detail is how AI and all of this potential connects with our ability to be more creative and social. Like, what are the applications that most excite you? you know, roam into the realm of business as well.</p><p id="""">But what are the key things that you think AI will augment in a positive way in our societies and culture moving forward? </p><p id="""">[00:15:31] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. So I think, I think first we have to, um, Just for a definition check, artificial intelligence has been around for like over 40 years, so, uh, it, this isn't the first time we've had assistance from computational power, and, and, uh, what's happening is that we're now able to do a lot more with a lot less energy, but because we can do a lot more, we're expanding that amount and that energy.</p><p id="""">Equation is still there and it's still heavily on my mind, particularly when you give everybody shovels, well, then the [00:16:00] mountain disappears. And so you have to be careful about the damage that you're doing. And that is the kind of part of the unknown questions when it comes to creativity, I think what I love about artificial intelligence and it comes back to, um, I'm part of this founders group and, and we do these away sessions and, and it's about kind of get out of your head type of stuff.</p><p id="""">And one of the founders did an activity with, I said, You know, who here could draw and like, I think two people put up their hand and he said, I bet you in an hour, every one of you can draw. And, and it was, it was an amazing thing because it was just totally untapped skill that I thought that I never had is that I couldn't draw.</p><p id="""">And it turns out everybody can draw. When you, when you dedicate your time to certain areas, you tend to play to your strengths. And the question is that then you feel that you cannot create in the area. That you might enjoy quite a bit, but you can't create there. And for me, again, I love business. I love business strategy.</p><p id="""">So what's really cool about, and what we're talking about is this wave of generative AI and, and kind of exceptionally broad learning at exceptional speed is, is that we can start to apply this in ways where. It's creativity beyond visual audio, the area that was reserved for the artists. But we can actually look at business artists.</p><p id="""">We can look at strategists actually saying, how do I get strategy into a tactical implementation? I'm looking at business leaders today. I mean, One of the greatest skills about a management team that you need to look for today is someone who can actually work and read a spreadsheet. I think that skill will be gone in about two years.</p><p id="""">I think that's going to get cracked and we'll be able to empower empathetic leaders, people who've always had the gut intuition around. If I make these people moves, we're going to get a kind of force multiplier effect on our business, except they couldn't make the economic argument, so it never got approved.</p><p id="""">And, and you're just like, well, You don't need to know the economics anymore because economics are just model theories and, and, and we could, that could get learned. We don't need to do that. And so I think there's a, when it comes to creativity, I think a couple of things, um, anyone now could create something.</p><p id="""">And because. People are typically going to create and in either domain they're very curious in or a domain that they feel strong in our prompts are going to get really strong. So I think what, what, what's going to happen there is you're going to have the experts creating in, in their area that, that are quite strong.</p><p id="""">Um, so we're going to see stronger and stronger prompts. So for those who want, who aren't an expert in that area can actually look over the experts who are probably hopefully sharing and some will and say, look at what I could do. I can now build a business plan. Two minutes I did. I literally did that yesterday.</p><p id="""">[00:18:40] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> And how was it? </p><p id="""">[00:18:41] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> It was amazing. It literally wrote my business plan. And I said, you know, in the market size, and can we get more numbers in there and reference points? And it did. And I was like, and it's, it lines up with half the numbers I already have. And I was like, Whoa, like this actually, and it's a good, strong narrative.</p><p id="""">I mean, we could. It's just absolutely nuts what you could do with this stuff. Um, but, but I think the other aspect here is, is that there is no good feedback loop for the creator. So currently that to me is still the sticking point and the friction point is you sit there and go. I've just created something and I, I noticed it while I was creating the business plan.</p><p id="""">I was sitting going, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like nodding my head as it started to write. I'm like, it's like watching somebody work. It's like when you, when you have a good fun and I'm such a nerd here, but when you have a good finance person and they're sitting there going, Oh, but what if we move the cash this way?</p><p id="""">Would that change the cashflow? Or would What if we did this to the budget? How would that change the forecast? And they're, and they're like doing it real time. Like, yeah, yeah, that looks good. Yeah. Yeah. It's like magic. So watching people work in their strength. I mean, here, you've got an awesome SPARI part to say, so do you mean this?</p><p id="""">And this is like your awesome copy partner when it comes to the written form and the language models, uh, mid journey. I'm, I'm starting to explore that. I can't wait to see that. Cause that's an awesome visualization partner. </p><p id="""">[00:19:59] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> [00:20:00] What is mid journey? </p><p id="""">[00:20:01] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So I would be the last person asked to describe it to you. I am literally just getting into it, but what it, what it does do is it starts to look at, um, generative imagery.</p><p id="""">Uh, and so if you, again, what, what they've done to language models, they've taken into images and, and being able to describe those and connect those to language. So when somebody describes an image, they get a language and, and, but you can create like avatars, fake people, all that type. I mean, it's, it's amazing.</p><p id="""">[00:20:29] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> It's just bonkers. I saw one of my good friend's partner has been fiddling around with, um, it was an avatar generating AI platform, which created portraits of him in different styles. And so this raises so many interesting questions. I know in the States, there's some interesting kind of lobbying happening around, you know, Copyright and what happens to artists when their work gets, quote unquote, mined without consent.</p><p id="""">I mean, there's all sorts of interesting battles that are heading our way. When it comes to things like creativity, I can understand how a business plan or computing in like a sort of a research based or financial way Would be something to which this would apply and be absolutely brilliant and, and probably not have so many problems, but if it's someone's music or their art, things that we also connect to, or like a screenplay, let's say, I mean, I can imagine Netflix, they've probably already done this, I can imagine like a platform like Netflix or Amazon going, right, these are the kinds of shows that get the most traction.</p><p id="""">I want you to do a new show and create something in the style of X, what do you think are going to be the battlegrounds? In terms of creating guardrails or limits that enable AI to help us in the domains where we need it, but don't end up undermining human culture and the things that maybe we think of as sacred or </p><p id="""">[00:21:49] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> well, this goes back a little bit to the point of what is human culture.</p><p id="""">I mean, there's an entire car culture that didn't exist when there weren't cars. And so again, it's just a technological advancement. There's going to be an entire culture. And, and I think the, the obvious one, and actually there's finally an article that came out about it recently about the American smile and yeah.</p><p id="""">And, and, and I think that's, that's bang on it. Cause it was so people are saying, oh yeah, here's a Biden and Trump hanging out. I'm like, why are their teeth so perfect all the time? And that's, and it's, it's those small little things that as a human, you kind of clock go, that's just not. normal, they're abnormally white.</p><p id="""">Like there's somehow the machine has thought the teeth need to be perfectly white all the time and perfectly straight. And the jaw needs to be boxed. It's like, so there's, there's all these small little things that I. That I think where, where I think there's a couple of different areas where battlegrounds come in and one you are going to have a massive battleground a decision to do about original content versus generated content or the amount of generated content influence in the creation process.</p><p id="""">I personally think that's actually the wrong place to focus. I do think that it's actually about creating tooling to help, uh, identify or either, and if you want to focus there, then verify it, I mean, just have a verification system, but what we haven't solved even for social media pre this era, what we haven't solved is moderation.</p><p id="""">And moderation hasn't been done very well at all. And now you're exploding the content stream. So we're continuing. So first we solved the amplification problem. If we call it a problem, first, we solved the amplification element technologically, but that totally got rid of really the human impact. It was, you know, fail fast.</p><p id="""">Fail often to build your capitalistic business, but at what cost? Well, somebody has to deal with that failure. And then at that point, so consumer. So then the, the, then amplification was done. Now creation has already started with all these creator tools, creator platforms, the explosion of the platforms will last two to three years, but here's this new Tik TOK [00:24:00] format, here's this new carousels format and all these new formats for creation.</p><p id="""">So that's great. That empowered a bunch of people and our creators went from like, A movie industry of, you know, 300 really kind of key stakeholders to like 3000 X, what that was. Um, and anybody and their brother and sister with like 200 pounds could pretty much become an influencer if they, they, they, they do the right thing.</p><p id="""">But there's still an element of, you still need the buy in of your audience. And, and again, even the amplification that just gets the word out there. It still doesn't keep the, the, the human in the feedback loop. And then I think what the generative stuff is, again, it's about putting the human in the feedback loop.</p><p id="""">And so we continue to build these technologies that are very much individual out, rather than a recursive relationship of saying, okay, it goes out and it comes back and oh, that was actually really shit and I've caused damage here. And therefore I'm actually regulated based off of that. That capability.</p><p id="""">So I think there's that one. I think the, the second one is related to that is you touched on it a little bit is regulation, uh, which is largely driven by kind of the ethics and moral set out by your society, which largely sits within your current governance systems. I think we are on the precipice of a big geopolitical refactor of the world as it is.</p><p id="""">Um, it was already in play and I am not sure. I get why OpenAI did what they did, but </p><p id="""">[00:25:34] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> What do you mean when you say this? </p><p id="""">[00:25:35] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> I get that, uh, I get that OpenAI, you know, I mean, they've totally redefined and created a whole new category that big tech hadn't really covered, and frankly Google hadn't really got there, of being able to enable anybody to actually really have a real sensible conversation with the internet, almost as a whole community.</p><p id="""">And, and open up that capability to the world and put it in the hands of everyone. But what But I think it was a little bit naive, uh, put out there on the, with the governance systems and saying, Oh, well, yeah, but U. S. thinks that we could use this for good, but you've got, there's a lot of unsolved bad actor elements out there.</p><p id="""">And frankly, regulation just has not, we need to move to regulation by design, not regulation after the fact world. And my view on this is particularly with a little bit of an East versus West. geopolitical environment starting to kick up. We have to be really careful here. Um, and because these tools are great, but then, you know, then when big tech and all the Western companies go, we're going to put a hiatus on this for six months so that we can get regulation order.</p><p id="""">It's the right thing to do is the regulations, the right thing, but putting a hiatus. That just gives anybody who doesn't agree with your value system six months to catch up. </p><p id="""">[00:26:53] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> It's that whole race to the bottom again. </p><p id="""">[00:26:55] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> It's that race to the bottom. And, and we have to really, really carefully here. So I think your battleground, I think we're going to see geopolitical battlegrounds on this one.</p><p id="""">I think we are going to see fundamental ethical, moral identities challenged in this one. And then kind of at the copyright level. I mean, unfortunately, the traditional copyright system, the way it actually shook out was putting all the power into the hands of very few people. I mean, look at record labels.</p><p id="""">I mean, that the music industry is prime example. Video industry is not too far behind or video movie and TV industry is not too far behind. So, uh, yeah, I mean, I'm all about democratizing this. I think. It shouldn't be in the hands of few. I think creativity shouldn't be limited. And I think frankly, everybody should be able to create anything they want to go and create.</p><p id="""">And the market will, but, but as long as the market or the audiences have a voice. And so I think we need to start putting people back in the feedback loop. </p><p id="""">[00:27:55] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> You just had a crazy thought with that. So like, and I was thinking about some of the key players [00:28:00] that advance. technological innovation. So if we're thinking about, and this is one of the reasons why I have this show marked explicit, because sometimes you move into this territory, thinking about pornography, for instance, and the darker side.</p><p id="""">So I'm talking about now the consensual, and I do believe that can be ethical pornography. I don't imagine it's particularly common, but I have met people who work in that area. Um, but then there's a whole rest of the world of pornography where people get exploited. And I'm, I'm thinking on the positive side that if it becomes possible to create.</p><p id="""">avatars that are lifelike, like for instance, now in a non pornographic context, the Levi models or other models that have been generated. Yes, of course, some people are gonna be put out of work, but I wonder if there's also the opportunity to create an entire or replace an entire exploitative ecosystem with sexism.</p><p id="""">AI generated content that then removes pressure. And this is, again, this is quite a layered conversation to have. Maybe it merits this entire season, but that there's a potential to alleviate human suffering by replacing industries that at their heart are generally speaking, in most cases, exploitative.</p><p id="""">And so while we're thinking about creativity and business cases and innovation and culture and ethics, there's some really key tangible examples to my mind where. Disruption could be absolutely extraordinary on, on various different levels. I kind of, I don't mean to derail you. </p><p id="""">[00:29:28] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> I mean, I really like this cause so a couple of things kind of come to mind here.</p><p id="""">First of all, in order to tackle kind of the, the human data problem that we had to tackle, we ended up having to work with people who knew how to stream really high quality data streams. In real time, uh, which led us to the people who built the underlying video streaming ecosystem for MindGeek, who are the owners of Pornhub and MindGeek own about 80 percent of the pornography, online pornography industry, um, also based out of Montreal.</p><p id="""">And they are, uh, also backed by Canadian ethical fund. Really? So it's a fascinating, fascinating, uh, very complicated thing. Well, when you become the 80 percent owner of the industry, you also become the number one enforcement regulator. So, and, and similar things are happening with gambling, right? So it's very, uh, I find, I find this, the, the, the, the area of pornography I find interesting because of exactly as you said, there's sex workers and there's people that have been exploited for sex.</p><p id="""">And, uh, the demand is huge. Um, obviously, uh, because all one has to do is look at the amount of data transferred on the web and how much of that's pornography and you can just tell that the demand is huge. But I think what it is, it's people exploring kind of an area that were taboo topics, but they had no place to safely explore.</p><p id="""">And in order to get that exploration done, there had to be content that was produced, uh, for that, which means you had to have real people doing it. So I certainly take the point. And I think that this is a very interesting area that if you could actually, and, and, and you started to see this democratize a little bit with like things like OnlyFans.</p><p id="""">And stuff like that. So, so you start to see, see these areas, but I think what's fascinating about, um, uh, both the industry and how that industry is playing out is first of all, we're finally opening up the conversation. So like. I mean, the, the sex toy industry and, um, hedonism resorts and stuff like that's all kind of even on, on the upswing and it's more openly talked about, but even just the, and what's really, really great to see as a, as an offshoot of this is just the focus on women's health.</p><p id="""">Yeah. Just the fundamental focus on women's health and how much it was ignored. I mean, my, my, my mom, uh, worked at, [00:32:00] uh, and, and helped set up the birth control clinic in our hometown back in the eighties and nineties. Um, and, and every day she'd come home, like talking about some of the cases that she has and.</p><p id="""">And it was fascinating growing up in that environment because for us, like, sex was a pretty, I mean, we could talk about sex very openly and you could pretty much tell me anything to do with sex and I probably wouldn't be surprised and I've probably heard it before and probably know exactly which resource to go check out if it's got to do with something negative.</p><p id="""">That's so useful. Yeah, like it's a, it's a very interesting area. And it's a very human, biological thing. I mean, it's. It is fundamentally what makes us human in, in a very big way and how we identify ourselves. So I think in a world of, of generative artificial intelligence, there is a huge opportunity here to, and again, this is where you have your actual sex professionals who love doing it.</p><p id="""">They like the work, they make a lot of money through the work, uh, and, and they only have to do certain things in order to be able to get, and, and open this up to an imaginative sphere that obviously. Might not be intenable, um, or whatever. And, and I think now whether it feeds the wrong behaviors and traits, again, you got to let the audience decide that and, and the market decide that and your governance decide that, and this, and this is where that runs into the regulation side, but depending on where you live.</p><p id="""">And how they approach those topics, I think it's up to them. I don't think governments or anyone should be expected to change their approach to pornography. And I think every country should be free to exercise that approach. That's their society. They're, they're in those positions to govern that way. Um, but more importantly that those who feel that they want to work in, in that industry also shouldn't be.</p><p id="""">be subject to being exploited beyond the bounds of, uh, of, of the area that they feel comfortable. And I think what the generative stuff allows us to do is you could take a snippet of that and then go into the realm of where it might be uncomfortable for that particular individual. But it actually could still work again.</p><p id="""">I think you'd probably want approval. So for me, the other battleground is I didn't sign off on this. I didn't approve this. Somebody's like all these fake images about Trump and Biden going around. And so it's like, you know, but none of them approved it. And, and I think that would be the, for me, that would be the authenticity challenge, and we're going to have to get really smart all the way down to our education system of saying.</p><p id="""">Question everything. </p><p id="""">[00:34:34] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> So I think from that perspective with the authenticity, there is a question around how do you prepare people to discern what's authentic and what's not. And when, when we're saying authentic, I'm guessing here that we mean something that is what it claims to be. So if it's like an AI generated learning aid and it says I'm an AI generated learning aid, look at me.</p><p id="""">I'm great. And it's really useful. Great. But not to pretend to be something that you're not. So there's something around, um, being able to. Uh, vouch for something's provenance, really, how do you imagine that's going to take off? Is there a way to legislate for that? Because I think in terms of human being, being dupable, </p><p id="""">[00:35:13] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> we </p><p id="""">[00:35:13] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> are so easily duped as humans and you know, nevermind with all of the things like confirmation bias and the rest of it.</p><p id="""">The kind of content that we consume, look at the pandemic, there was so much misinformation in political campaigns in recent years. It's just so easy, even in my family, for people to send articles and them not be referenced properly and no one's actually bothered to check before sending them on. Like, it's just human nature not to be constantly vigilant for the authenticity of the content that we're consuming or sharing.</p><p id="""">What can we do about that? Do you think </p><p id="""">[00:35:41] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> I mean, that's a massive topic, but if I could solve that, I'd be a very wealthy person right now. Yeah, right. Wealthy and benevolent. Um, so I think rather than the kind of going to the solution, really exploit the problem a little bit. One is, I think authenticity is two sided.</p><p id="""">So one [00:36:00] is it's somebody either trying to pose as something else or somebody or something trying to pose as something else. Right. Uh, so that's intentional. Uh, and then the other side is whether people buy into it. I think, uh, first of all, society, we have to be taught that everything is an opinion now and nothing is fact anymore.</p><p id="""">Um, and, and actually that's not an unhealthy, uh, I think we're very quick to say it's a fact because five people said so in my circle group and it's like, well, it's not. Um, and. And by, by removing the escalation into this is concrete, it's like, no, I just have a strong opinion and everybody's allowed their strong opinion.</p><p id="""">That's frankly allowed. And some people hold them loosely and some people hold them strongly. And honestly, it doesn't really matter. I think it, I think it's going to help us evolve to become. And again, I think this is your natural evolution. We've created technology. That's now going to push humanity to rather than being right by being the knowledge expert.</p><p id="""">No longer going to be the knowledge expert in the room. Uh, but those that are going to be, I think we'll start to, or so what we're going to start to see is then the shift of saying, great, now that we have this knowledge, what's next. And it's going to shift us from a planning oriented society to a growth oriented society on the benevolent side.</p><p id="""">Um, and what I mean by that is that before I was the best person to write the plan because I knew the most. And so I was the person who could probably see around the corners and write a plan that had the highest likelihood of succeeding. Whereas, uh, now it's, well, you can consume everything that I know in about 10 minutes, arguably down the path.</p><p id="""">Um, and not that you'd want to, um, but, but you could consume everything that I know in about 10 minutes. Uh, but now that facilitates us to have a, you're caught up. So now we can have the conversation about, okay, what next? What, what else do we want to try with our time, time being the valuable thing? What else do we want to do with our time?</p><p id="""">And, and I think that if we can take down the value of, of, of fact versus opinion and just go, everything's now an opinion, like even in science, it's an opinion, even though it may have been proven time and time again, let's just call it an opinion. I mean, the greatest one that we came across was there's over a hundred years of psychology saying that there are universal expressions and emotions.</p><p id="""">We're not seeing that in the data. We've never seen that in the data. And so we found a better way to measure that and say, like, actually when, or, and, and it may just be that the way you can measure versus the theory are just never going to align. But in the world of application, where we do want to know when mental wellness is an issue, we want to be able to track our psychological state.</p><p id="""">It's really important that you understand that there's a difference there and you're able to have a constructive conversation around that. And so I think that that's the first bit. The second bit, actually, I think the answer is already sitting in front of us in terms of copyright and authenticity is we've already developed a system of being able to use blockchains to keep provenance.</p><p id="""">It's already there. It's disconnected at the moment, but it won't take long that once the regulators say, well, if 30 percent of this or more is AI generative, then it's open net, whatever, if it's less than that, then we can call it authentic or, or proprietary capability. So, so I think both of those, but the other thing that I think we're going to see, and this is again, in the IP world, intellectual property.</p><p id="""">Okay. Well, it's your property kind of just doesn't exist anymore. Like, and, and the system's so backlogged anyway, that to get to enforceability, I mean, gosh, the amount of time it takes to get a [00:40:00] tech patent through the American courts all the way through to enforceability, like you've lost 10 years. I mean, it just, that made sense in pharma, but even in pharma, you could disrupt pharma tomorrow with the base knowledge that they already had.</p><p id="""">Like, so, so I think there's, I think we're on a wave of seeing some fundamental pillars. Get struck down and rebuilt in a different way. </p><p id="""">[00:40:23] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> I mean, the scope for change on a really fundamental level is huge. And one of the things that, that we've touched on in the past that I'd love to include in the conversation before, before you run out of time, there's so many areas to explore is a point that you've raised on various occasions around energy ethics.</p><p id="""">[00:40:37] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. </p><p id="""">[00:40:38] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> Can you talk us through that? Through what energy ethics is and why it's so important because it does connect to a lot of the issues that I'm concerned about on the podcast and many people who are concerned about the future of humanity and all of life are also concerned about. </p><p id="""">[00:40:50] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So what is it? So the cost of energy is coming down in a sense, but it's moving to renewables and all of that fun stuff.</p><p id="""">Right. Let me start with breaking down the problem. Basically, if you take a generative AI tool and then you give it out to the masses, every time somebody puts a prompt in, it has to go into this massive machine brain. </p><p id="""">[00:41:09] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> So every time my little cousin's kid takes out GPT, puts in a prompt, isn't this fun? Ha ha.</p><p id="""">Great. </p><p id="""">[00:41:14] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. </p><p id="""">[00:41:15] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> This is what you're talking about. </p><p id="""">[00:41:15] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. Every time they ping that server and the server has to crunch and throw stuff back, there's energy involved in keeping those servers up and running, making sure the calculations can be done and then throwing that prompt back. And of course, then you just, I mean, nailed the system.</p><p id="""">These data centers, while they might be more and more efficient and running, you have to keep your coal fire power plants up and running to be able to fuel that. And so it still becomes a war around energy. Um, and a war around attention. So attention is about getting as much creative out there as possible, which, which both of these are actually, it's, uh, they're both escalating effects, uh, on the environmental sustainability element.</p><p id="""">So, I mean, if you just had everybody in the world unplug for one hour a day, Can you imagine how much energy would be saved? So I think the ethical implication of artificial intelligence is that it needs to keep mining and feeding. And basically we've moved, uh, these kilojoules of kind of energy from our brain power onto a machine and then just to just crank the dial.</p><p id="""">And the irony here is that artificial intelligence is probably going to help us solve this problem. But until we have really good understanding of renewable resourcing and full supply chain. mechanics of energy, uh, distribution. A lot of this stuff, a lot of stuff that slips through the cracks because.</p><p id="""">One aspect of the supply chain just isn't factored into the energy equation. And so until we have a really good macro view that is well beyond the comprehension of a single individual or human being of the energy cost to have these servers run and have them hit this many times and have the creation happen as many times.</p><p id="""">I mean, think about screens need to go up. You need to have an image to put up there, all that type of stuff until that happens. Um, we're not really going to solve an energy issue. And in fact, if anything, we're just absolutely bombarding and putting major stress on the energy ecosystem, which means it's now about maintenance and, and putting more and more power in and not actually solving the real problem, which is renewable energy.</p><p id="""">And so I think we do have an ethical issue here of saying, I think we should throttle based off of energy. I mean, the other part is like, do you take that energy away from people being able to actually heat their homes and have a comfortable enough environment so that they can. Actually read for school and learn like, or take it away from the hospitals.</p><p id="""">Like, I mean, there are some fundamentals that we can't get carried away. And the, and the, the challenge with the innovation community is that. Once they see a string that they can pull on, they will pull, they will yank. And so I think we just, that's where we have to be careful. Um, because the energy [00:44:00] ethics on this one, really, really, really important.</p><p id="""">The data's heavier, it's getting bigger. The compute power, I don't know if it's keeping in line. I'd have to look into that, but I don't know if it's really keeping in line. But regardless, you have to turn these servers on, these research cores that are massively expensive. So hopefully quantum computing will help with that a little bit, but probably not yet.</p><p id="""">Um, and hopefully artificial intelligence will be able to give us full energy consumption supply chain analysis to tell us, is lithium ion battery the best thing out there? Or, And, and what type of destruction does that do globally as well? So there's impact beyond just carbon, um, and energy consumption.</p><p id="""">So I think there's elements there. I also don't think that we should turn our noses up at oil. I think we need to continue looking at oil, just be much more effective about how we do it right now. A lot of the loss of value. In the energy of oil is the fact that where we pull it out of the ground is miles away from where it gets refined, which is miles away from where it gets consumed.</p><p id="""">So the transport costs in between is horrible. Like these ideas of not building a pipeline and environmentalist coming and saying, not building a pipeline for oil to get from one place to the next means you have to put it on trucks or railroads. Like, I mean, my brother works at dirt and I think this is a very good example as well.</p><p id="""">Another metaphorical example is. You know, just because naturally a river might have a lot of copper in it, but it doesn't meet the topsoil requirements for environmental, for environmental concerns, you have to truck that out of the city, remediate it and truck it back in. Well, what's the fuel cost you just used on this?</p><p id="""">So we're doing the same thing in technology now too is great. I have to move this stuff around. There's a cost to all of this. And I think, again, opening it up to the public. And saying everybody can now create, it's a, I agree with that ethos, but we want to do it sustainably. </p><p id="""">[00:45:54] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> It's so tricky, isn't it?</p><p id="""">Because it, it calls to my mind, like the, the fact that often we need, um, how do I want to put this? I've referenced this on the show before. It was this idea of phase transition and the example of the egg and the chick. eating the white of the egg and getting to the point where it's running out of food and at that point its digestive tract is strong enough to be able to eat outside food and it's strong enough physically to be able to break out of its shell but to get to that point it has to consume all the egg white and it doesn't realize what's going on until it reaches that threshold.</p><p id="""">Obviously it's a very simple metaphor for something which is perhaps more complicated but I think it's a really interesting question and all of the issues that you're raising endemic within the answer is everything's complex everything's entangled and maybe the question has to also involve the fact that we need to innovate more in order to get the point where we can get technological solutions to help us in a real way, address some of the issues.</p><p id="""">And that the, at the same time, although the answers might be facilitated by the tech that we're employing to help us crunch through the data, find correlations, run the assessments, make informed suggestions about how to move forward. We still have to employ the human creativity, ethic, visioning, you know, all of this kind of stewardship mentality to be able to make sense of what we're gaining from AI or what have you.</p><p id="""">To kind of chart a path forward that there's got to be some sort of collaboration. But the thing that I always worry about is like, At what point is it too late? Like how close to that cliff edge do we get? Because historically it's really fucking close. You know, the cold war generation, that's my parents.</p><p id="""">This is, this is not even old history. No, it's, it's right around the corner. </p><p id="""">[00:47:36] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> And we're looking at the next one. Uh, I think to answer your, your other question, the, the, the re the only thing I didn't really understand with the rollout of all of this is you've just created this wonderful ability to consume all of the knowledge around a particular subject area if you wanted to.</p><p id="""">So learn X. Why did you not roll this out to climate change first, knowing that that's your biggest cost driver in order to enable your service? [00:48:00] So, for me, if I was sitting kind of in the seat, the hot seat of big tech right now, I would be sitting there going like, Okay. Our carbon costs are massive in order to drive this stuff.</p><p id="""">That's the big sustainability concern and sustainability is an issue right now, globally. Like it doesn't matter how good the AI is. If we burn ourselves to death in five years, it doesn't really matter. So I think the big thing here was knowing that my servers use so much and that it's putting so much power, the first place is.</p><p id="""">Give it to the people studying this. They know all the resources to learn, build up that body of knowledge and solve that problem before you open it up so that you're constantly building again, sustainable by design, regulated by design. That's the problem is we're going, here's a really cool piece of innovation, throw it out to them.</p><p id="""">We're still using those old techniques of fail, fast, fail often. And it's not. I'd really love to see fail sustainably. So fail in a way that's still a rising tide. Don't fail in a way that's going to injure somebody in India. Who's now got to deal with, you know, uh, 50 odd degree summers. Uh, in Celsius or a hundred odd degrees Thomerson, you know, and, and just people are just dying because of it.</p><p id="""">And it's like, like, let's think about how to fail sustainably versus fail fast and fail often. </p><p id="""">[00:49:22] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> I would love to hear if anyone's listening to this and knows of any organizations, tech companies that are working in this domain, please let me know, I'd love to have them on the show. And so we're moving to the end of our conversation, which is crazy because I have so many more questions and there's so many other things that we could talk about.</p><p id="""">But one of the things I would like to ask is. Because you are a deep thinker and the number of conversations you've had, which have roamed all sorts of depths. I'm curious to ask, when you dive into the darker areas of life, where you get hit with overwhelm, how do you orient yourself towards life and wholeness on difficult days?</p><p id="""">[00:49:55] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Uh, there's two aspects to me that Always re center me and both of them are entirely non technical. Um, the first is, uh, fresh air, I need to get back to the land. So last weekend I went lambing and I went to pulled a little lamb out of a ewe and it was like, and, and then kind of clearing its nose of, uh, of, of the liquid and all of a sudden, like the first breath, there's just nothing more satisfying, like you just, okay.</p><p id="""">Life is still here. That's the first one. So get outside. And the second one is really people. Just Identity and knowing who you are and grounding around that is just surround yourself with people who Challenge you but always challenge you with your best interests at heart Um, so, and, and once you could trust that somebody is going to challenge you with your best interests.</p><p id="""">And I mean, we, we have this, uh, uh, it's, it's great because they fundamentally help you get back to the path that you were meant to be on. So you're not sitting there two years later with regrets saying, Oh, well, I was just doing this for somebody else. No, you always want to be every hour is for you. So choose your hours wisely.</p><p id="""">And, and, and for me, it's get outside and get back to people. So. Like, this conversation provides a lot of value for me. But yeah, I think, I think that's, that's it. Nothing technical at all. I actually hate being in front of a screen. </p><p id="""">[00:51:22] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> Analog and wonderful. Um, so I realized we've not really talked too much about Element Human, but I do want people to be able to know where to find you and find out more.</p><p id="""">Uh, so if people want to learn more about your work, where are the best places to go? </p><p id="""">[00:51:35] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Uh, sure. I mean, our marketing is atrocious cause we haven't done any. Uh, so the best way is probably to give me a call. Um, uh, or I think Matt. At element human. com. Uh, we do have a website element human. com. Uh, and then, but I think the best place is LinkedIn.</p><p id="""">We're starting to ramp that up and we're doing some really cool work. So you will be able to see some news come out over the next couple [00:52:00] of months. You'll also see presentations coming on at the can, uh, and just at a really high level, our, our goal is to build the emotional layer for the internet. So how do we.</p><p id="""">Bring people back into the loop so that we can self regulate these systems that are coming online and self regulate our amplification and creativity. </p><p id="""">[00:52:18] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> Brilliant. </p><p id="""">[00:52:18] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> So how do we make the world emotionally aware again? </p><p id="""">[00:52:21] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> Emotionally. I think a lot of us could do that, but the thing is getting people who might not realize they need it most.</p><p id="""">To do it. </p><p id="""">[00:52:26] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Yeah. The key with all this stuff is always just embedding it into the ecosystem that they're already operating in. Uh, and so, so empathizing, empowering. Yeah. And then engaging. </p><p id="""">[00:52:37] <strong id="""">Nathalie Nahai:</strong> Well, Matt, it's been a pleasure. I think we're going to have to get you back on to talk more about some of these subjects, but for now, thank you so much.</p><p id="""">It was such a treat. </p><p id="""">[00:52:44] <strong id="""">Matt Celuszak:</strong> Thank you, Natalie.

Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us today. Before we kick off what I know is gonna be a passionate and dare I say fun, entertaining panel hands up who has anything to do with helping brands grow their business. Good news. You're in the right room. So over the last two days, I've been to a number of panels.</p><p id="""">And for the first time, I've heard the word creator far more than I've heard AI. And Dan's right. It is, this is the creator revolution. And finally, creators are influencers. They're taking up spaces that they should have for a very long time. From Cannes to DC, they are center stage. And the reason for that is simple.</p><p id="""">Creators drive business results. Creators and influencers, they have impact on helping brands grow their business. So that sets the scene for the conversation we're going to have over the next 25, 30 minutes. My name is Jo Cronk and I am for sure a very lucky individual because I get to lead Whalar. Whalar is a incredible collective of creatives, of folks that think about things in a slightly different way.</p><p id="""">And because of that, we are the most awarded and largest global independent creator and social agency. So I also get to share the stage with these two wonderful folks, Hamish and Jasmine. Hamish, let's start with you. Share a few words. Why are you here? Why do you care about creators? </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: Hello everyone, how we doing?</p><p id="""">How's everyone doing? They told me it was really bright up here and it really is. It's also very, </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: very hot. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: It's hot, it's bright. But this is, this is the world of creators guys. These are our selfie lights. What do we call those things anyway? The little rings. I feel like I'm, I'm a creator myself. I need to create.</p><p id="""">My name is Hamish McFarlane. I'm the MD for a company called Element Human. We are a behavioral AI company and we are very happy to be and grateful to be the measurement partner and measurement supplier for Whalar. We measure the power and impact of creator marketing, around the world.</p><p id="""">We've got thousands and thousands of tests that we've done. Over five years, I think we've realized incredible relationship. And, we leverage best in class methodologies that include attention. So we look at, we use eye tracking to measure how much attention, creative content is getting in the feed, whether it's on Instagram or Tik TOK or elsewhere.</p><p id="""">We also are huge believers in the power of measuring emotion and real human interaction. So I know we've talked a lot about AI. In a lot of presentations, we're all about real humans, real creators, and real audiences and measuring them. And we're so grateful that Wayla are real believers in that, the power of real human data, and collecting that and analyzing it to really understand what moves the needle when it comes to brands.</p><p id="""">So we use a facial coding to measure emotion, how people are responding and reacting to content. And then we tie that together with a brand goal. So understanding just because content. worked in a storytelling perspective. Did it move the needle for the brands that are investing in it? And what is the art of incredible storytelling that gets reach, gets engagement, but also gets the brand what it needs as well.</p><p id="""">It's a delicate balance. And every day is an adventure. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: I love it. Jasmine </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: over to you. I'm Jasmine Emberg. I am a vice president and principal analyst at eMarketer where I lead our coverage of social media and the creator economy. My job is to use data and research to provide insights and help marketers cut through the noise and really understand what's going on within social media and influencer marketing.</p><p id="""">And I've been following the space for the past seven years or so, and there has been so much evolution, so much growth. So I am super happy to be here on stage with both of you today to talk about it all. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: We're going to start with you because I think like a lot of us at Whalar, you are talking to brands and CMOs.</p><p id="""">Every single day. What are you hearing from the market about creative marketing and where it sits in the wider advertising landscape? </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: So I have been calling 2024 the year of legitimacy for the creator economy and for influencer marketing, and it is long overdue, but I think we're finally in this moment where every CMO understands that they have to be working with creators and influencers.</p><p id="""">There's a lot of different reasons for this. Joe, you mentioned some of them during the introduction, whether that's the dedicated creator track, it can or the creator economy conference in DC. Or the fact that YouTube now beat Netflix in terms of watch [00:05:00] time. And it's done that primarily on the back of creator and user generated content.</p><p id="""">And so at eMarketer, we're expecting about 80 percent or over 80 percent of us marketers to work with creators and influencers this year, which hopefully you can see up on the screen over there. I will say, however, that it's not that every CMO is rushing towards creators and influencers with open arms.</p><p id="""">I still. do hear quite a bit of hesitancy and reluctancy, and I'm sure that resonates with many of you in this room as well as the lack of understanding on in how to build a sustainable creator and influencer strategy. But I think the difference today from years past is that that hesitancy doesn't really come from quote unquote brand safety concerns to the same extent, and it doesn't necessarily come from this idea of Creator content lacking in quality when you compare it to studio produce creative, but rather more the risk of investing in a tactic that is seemingly more difficult to measure than some of the other digital channels out there.</p><p id="""">And that to me is sort of the next step and what needs to be solved so that the CMO can go to the CFO and tell an easier story about creator marketing and why it works. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: I completely agree. I think for us, like the CFO is as much our client is the CMO. And again, as it should be, and that's really important.</p><p id="""">So Hamish, like we're talking a lot about like data and how we measure this really like emerging, but also maturing media and creative tactic. I think what we're sitting on now, like over 2000 unique creative campaigns that you've measured. For us, that feels about right. So over 2, 000. First of all, talk about that sample size of over 2, 000 campaigns and then share some of like the headlines.</p><p id="""">Like, what are you seeing across all of those incredible </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: campaigns? The macro trends, right? </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Yeah. Let's start high up. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: If we can really boil down over the years that we've worked together and the measurement, as I say, the very human measurement of how People and audiences respond to create a content.</p><p id="""">The key to me is number one, it works. And I don't just mean it works in that, that creators can get great reach or that they can get a lot of clicks to put purchase a product. But between those two points is a huge amount of information that most agencies don't really have any, anything to say about because they're not measuring it properly.</p><p id="""">And that is true engagement and true branding campaigns, right? Campaigns that aren't just asking you to download an app today. or, or buy something or click some kind of affiliate link, but big powerful brands that need to be communicating with the market every month, every year, those brands who are becoming involved in creator marketing, they're asking questions.</p><p id="""">They've got expectations about the types of measurement that they're used to seeing in more traditional metrics. And frankly, I don't think a lot of agencies have an answer yet. And I think the industry really needs to kind of level up in that regard. But for those that do, I think what you do see is That, creator campaigns can work at every level of the funnel.</p><p id="""">Yes, they can get reach. We know that. Yes, they can get clicks and conversions. We know that. But they can also really work at a branding level, in the, as we call it, the middle of the funnel. And our belief, and mine particularly over the 18 years that I've worked in the industry, is that the key to that is emotion.</p><p id="""">And that's why we measure emotion. It's all very well that a campaign reached a lot of people. But that is really just a metric that tells you people love the story. What about the brand? What about the brand that is somewhere inside that story? Is it getting what it needs out of it? Is it able to harness the power of that creator content?</p><p id="""">The key to that is emotion. Creators are master storytellers. That's how they became what they are. That's how agencies like Whalar recognize the power of those storytellers and bring them into the fold and start to kind of leverage the power that they give them to access those amazing intimate spaces wherever they're creating them.</p><p id="""">What is it that they're actually doing though? They're stimulating emotion. So we need to measure that. And we've got data that shows that there's a direct correlation between the emotion that you can get out of people, that you can kind of elicit out of your audience, and brand goals. And I'm not just talking about clicks, but I'm talking about true long term memory of brands, what we would call like a mental association with a brand.</p><p id="""">These are much more powerful, you Objectives for big brands than just clicks and, creators can do it. They can really, really do it. They like little media owners, millions and millions of them, their production companies, and they master storytellers who know their audiences and they know how to connect with them.</p><p id="""">And that's essentially what brands are doing is that they are being invited into this incredibly intimate space that has a high level of engagement. They're being invited in to, to participate in that. And sure. You can get it right and you can get it wrong. And I'm not saying that it's always going to smash it out of the park, but I guess the point is you've got to be able to measure it.</p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: So I think the net [00:10:00] net, it works. We know that it works. How's that translating in terms of where media spend media investment is going? </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: Yeah. So influencer marketing spending in the U. S. Is quickly on track to approach 10 billion. And I believe you can see that chart on the on the screen again, reaching 10 billion in 2026.</p><p id="""">And there's just been massive growth over the past couple of years. And Part of the reason for this is we've seen a shift from influencer marketing being just this splashy brand awareness tactic to really a full funnel marketing tactic. And over the past couple of years in particular, there's been a really strong rise in marketers turning to creators and influencers.</p><p id="""">To drive lower funnel goals like sales and conversions. And that's actually led to some really interesting trends in terms of how those dollars are being divvied up amongst the creator class. So we're seeing a lot of marketers really investing more heavily into some of the top name, top echelon creators, as well as smaller and nano and, micro influencers.</p><p id="""">And that's leaving a wide swath of creators who are in the middle. Which. Is very challenging for those creators because it creates a lot of competition. A lot of them talk about there being deal drought, but on the marketer's side, there's a lot of opportunity. And I think that speaks to what Hamish was saying in terms of having, you're working with these creators in order to drive consideration, drive that messaging, that memorability, and creating that emotion and engagement that ultimately can translate to sales.</p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Amazing. So again, you can see from this chart, the numbers don't lie. This is an addressable market. That is getting larger and larger with every year and that trend is not going to slow down. So Hamish Khan, my next question to you is like, where is this money going in terms of not the platforms, not the types of creators, but the types of campaigns, whether it be full final, different verticals, what are the trends that you're observing at the moment?</p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: It's changing, you know, and I guess it's really a, a, a signifier of the stage we're at, which is that creative marketing, I mean, we're looking at the data here, right? It's. It is, achieving that kind of, transcendence of the early adopters and the innovators and becoming much more mainstream. We talk to lots of agencies and I always ask them, you know, what is it that you're talking to and what is your argument, your sales argument?</p><p id="""">And a lot of them, I would ask them, do you need to convince brands to try creative marketing? And as I sit here today, the answer is no. We do not need. to convince brands to try Creator marketing. They all get it. Everybody wants to do it. No one knows how to do it. Well, very few know how to do it. And so there's a real question about the art of using and leveraging creators, for the most part and getting the most out of them.</p><p id="""">But they're not always going to be right for you. They're not always going to be right for you at a particular time and particular objectives. And so we're seeing this kind of change in the types of categories that are using the system, right? And, and working with companies like Whalar and so forth.</p><p id="""">I think initially, there are some big obvious categories. The, we're, we're making the most of it, personal care, beauty brands, apparel, you know, fashion and sport and that kind of thing really, really makes a lot of sense. But actually I, I've seen more recently there's been an expansion now of, the types of categories are getting involved and actually one I wanted to sort of put my hand up and say, watch this space is B2B, there are B it's there are B2B influencers out there.</p><p id="""">There are B2B companies using B2B influencers out there obviously. The stakes are a little higher there, you know, there's less sales, but bigger sales and there's kind of a story there about making that work. But I guess there's a point to be made that it's not just for Gen Z. </p><p id="""">And actually we sort of talked about this a week ago and, </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Guys, this is a slide worth taking a photo of.</p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: This is a golden one. I'll explain it. So Joe turned to me a week ago and said, is it just for Gen Z? And we said, we can answer that question by going into the data. So we've been measuring the power of. Whalers, creates a marketing for a long time, I can leverage the power of that. So this is, essentially I took three slices of our data, which is, I wanted to really look at the top of the funnel, in the middle, and at the bottom.</p><p id="""">So I took three slices. So one of them is unaided awareness, uplift. There's a lot of top of funnel metrics that we measure using different methodologies, but this is a quick and easy one. The other, the one in the middle is brand memory. So this is based on a, a psychological memory test that we do with our audiences to see if they're creating mental associations between the brand and its objective.</p><p id="""">Right? Samsung wants to be seen as premium. Rolex wants to be seen as luxurious. Rolex And so forth and so forth. Are we, are we, I mean this is really good branding stuff. Are we able to see an uplift in that? And then the final one is, obviously purchase intent. The increased desire to purchase a product.</p><p id="""">You might think that, you're gonna get [00:15:00] better results on the left side. The 18 to 24 year olds. This is based on, 1, 200 campaigns by the way. So this is really, really big, deep data. You can see obviously that, awareness is always gonna be higher because that's kind of the way the funnel works.</p><p id="""">But. Spare a thought for the 45 to 64 year olds guys, this ain't Gen Z and this is working for them too. In fact, if you really look at it, it's kind of working better for them. And that might confuse you, but we think we understand what's going on here, which is that the universe of creative marketing is expanding.</p><p id="""">It used to be, sure, the play thing of Gen Z, right? The young audiences get in there first, they get it, they get their hands dirty. It's expanding now. We have B2B, we have older audiences, we have older creators, and they're in there too, and they are making a difference. Now why is it that we've got a 217 percent uplift in awareness, for an older age group?</p><p id="""">Why is it that we've got a 23 percent uplift in purchase intent for an older age group? I think a lot of this is. They're a little newer, right? The, you move faster when you're new. You're starting from a lower point. This is an uplift, right? So, Gen Z know how the game works. They know how this works. Their data's gonna start kind of, maturing over time.</p><p id="""">But I guess what we're looking at here, particularly as we take this slice, which is true as of, you know, four or five days ago, in terms of our measurement. The older age groups are here, and they're using it too, and it's working. </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: And I just wanted to second that too, because that's something that we've seen reflected in our research too, and it's one of the more surprising findings from one of the research studies </p><p id="""">that I know that we're, we're gonna talk about in just a minute.</p><p id="""">But that is always the case, right? Whenever there is a new trend, a new technology, a new sort of marketing tactic, it's always the younger generations, that adopt it first. And then there's a, you know, trickle effect, and it moves on into older generations. And that's exactly the moment that we're in now, where we're seeing older generations also being much more attuned to creator content, much more influenced by creator content.</p><p id="""">And the evidence is right there. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: And we're seeing it all the time. I mean, one of the reasons that creators resonate so much with audiences is because they're not serving audiences. They're serving the communities that they've cultivated. Whoever you are, I'm loving this vibe. I feel like you get your channel, my man, like you get it </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: exactly.</p><p id="""">It's </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: like exactly, but it's about the communities and communities. Yes, it's often interest based and passion based, but it trend transcends all demographics as well. There is such a rise of like, we call like the older influencers, especially on tip top. Like you think about the most amazing fashion and beauty creators on Instagram.</p><p id="""">They've all got gray hair. And there's that movement happening at the moment, that like, age equals experience. It doesn't equal time for you to go and sit in a corner and be quiet. So finally this older demographic is having their moment as well. Which is like, leave this thought, it speaks to the inclusivity of this channel.</p><p id="""">Everybody is represented. Everybody has a corner of the internet that they can be part of in a safe, creative, and engaging way. </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: And that's why it's such a powerful tool for marketers. Because there is a way to reach diverse communities through all these different diverse voices who participate in the creator economy.</p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: So, the whole point of this is to talk about brand growth, and I feel like we can't talk about brand growth if we're not talking about commerce. So, this is the piece that you've just alluded to. </p><p id="""">This is another golden one. You might need to zoom in a bit, so apologies. But let's talk a bit about the research that you've just spearheaded and published just a few weeks ago.</p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: Yes, I'm super excited to talk about this because I haven't talked about this publicly yet, but this is a piece of proprietary research that we just conducted at a market are really looking at social shopping behaviors across all of the different platforms. And so there were a couple of key findings. I think the big one.</p><p id="""">The first big one was that among social shoppers, the type of content that most inspired them to make a purchase was creator or influencer content. It was ahead of brand and retailer content, as well as all different types of content that we measured. And there's a lot of reasons for this. I think it's really easy to say that it's because creator or influencer content is more engaging.</p><p id="""">And it is for the most part, but also there is just so much creator and influencer content out there, and we're seeing the platforms also prioritize it sometimes at the expense of other accounts, and that can cause challenges. It's harder than ever to break through, but it also means that brands really need to be working with creators because that's the type of content that people are engaging with online and the type of content that these platforms are prioritizing.</p><p id="""">And the second really interesting finding was looking at shoppers across the different platforms and who were most inspired by creator and influencer content. And you might think it's instagram or tiktok users, but actually it was snapchat users who came in first. [00:20:00] Of the people who had shopped on Snapchat, about 85 percent of them said they had also been inspired by creator or influencer content.</p><p id="""">The caveat here is that they could have seen that content somewhere else, whether that's Instagram, TikTok, or another platform. But it does speak to this really strong, growing opportunity on Snapchat. Especially as it leans more into brand and creator partnerships, as well as just, you know, the opportunity within creator overall.</p><p id="""">The one big exception to all of this, which you can see in one of the charts on the screen, is Facebook. And I think a lot of that speaks to the fact that, one, it is the biggest social commerce platform out there, but a lot of the shopping that happens on Facebook is, done on Marketplace. And so that's primarily a C2C shopping destination.</p><p id="""">If we were to exclude that, I think And I think that that figure would be quite a bit </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: higher. Was there anything shocking</p><p id="""">for you or when you saw the results, were you like, yeah, this like, this makes sense? </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: Yeah, I mean, I think the most surprising finding was the one about Snapchat being first. I wouldn't say it was necessarily shocking.</p><p id="""">I was just surprised by, you know, the fact that it really did, you know, beat out both TikTok and Instagram. Um But a lot of it was confirmation for what we already know to be true, but it's really great to be able to put hard data around it and say, you know, this is working and, and here's why it </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: makes a huge, </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: it makes a huge difference.</p><p id="""">And it goes back to that storytelling to the CFO. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Exactly. I mean, we're all accountable to a CFO, whether it's our, our direct CFO or somebody else's. So Hamish, I think like, again, it's, it works. It definitely, definitely works. From the position that you sit within the creative economy, why aren't more brands jumping in with both feet?</p><p id="""">Some have got a big toe in, some have got one foot, but why aren't we seeing more going full force? </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: Yeah, I think that's, that's the issue of the moment, is, as I said earlier, agencies tell me they don't have to convince brands to try it, but there's very little really good qualitative data on how to use it, and brands really, really need it.</p><p id="""">That advice. They need trusted agencies who have really good data and really good measured to be able to guide them effectively. I think every brand is terrified of falling afoul of the good opinion of the audience, right? Like, is it, is it worth it spending my marketing dollars and taking some kind of risk?</p><p id="""">So it really does need really good measurement. And I think, you know, speaking really frankly, I think a lot of social agencies get by on really shit measurement, pardon my language, but they've got really just top and bottom, bottom of funnel stuff. Yeah, you got some reach. Yeah, you got some clicks and you got some emojis.</p><p id="""">It's just not good enough. And if those agencies don't grow up and get real proper measurement the way other media channels are going, they're going to get left by the wayside. You need proper measurement to really understand the full length of the funnel and really being able to then effectively advise your brands on what to do and how to do it.</p><p id="""">And you can then avoid those pitfalls. Whalar this year on trying to find new ways of kind of characterizing our reporting to really understand, you know, if you're running a campaign and you've got ten creators out there, what's </p><p id="""">How did they work and how did they perform? So, we produced this and actually we just launched this officially yesterday, but you're getting </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: two launches here today.</p><p id="""">I know you're getting two exclusive exclusives. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: This is called <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.elementhuman.com/product/ssp"" id="""">Stopping &amp; Staying Power (SSP) framework</a>. And this is, yeah, I know. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Isn't that sexy? Say it out loud. S S P. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: Let's assess here. So this is essentially our test. Has obviously a lot of data in it. But this takes two particular slices. That, Whalar always asks us.</p><p id="""">Which is, is it getting attention? And then is it getting that brand into memory? And so what we've done is we've taken two particular slices. Stopping power, which is attention. That's that vertical axis. What this is basically doing is we have, you know, a gigantic data set of, viewability and attention of the data.</p><p id="""">Create a content inside the feed, whether that's inside the Instagram feed, inside the Tik Tok feed. It's, it's kind of a table stakes. You've got to get attention first. People got to stop the scroll and look at your content. Otherwise, nothing else is going to work, right? So that's, we've got to get that one first.</p><p id="""">Secondly, we need staying power. It's great that you told a great story, create it. You got a lot of emojis and laughs and shares and things like that. But did people walk away remembering And I can tell you, looking at the data, it doesn't always work. Just because a brand, or sorry, a creator got a huge reach score, or got a big pile of exposure, doesn't mean the brand can walk away and say they got what they needed out of that relationship.</p><p id="""">That's staying power. So this is a test that we use to measure mental associations with the brand. You want to be, if you're a creator, in the top right hand corner of that chart. That means against our global data set, you are ranking essentially in the top quarter of [00:25:00] the top 25 percent for stopping power, which means people are stopping to look at your content and staying power, which means people are coming away with an actual genuine memory of the brand that can turn into a purchase somewhere down the track.</p><p id="""">And don't forget, who's seen what actual click through rates look like? Hands up if you've seen actual click through rates. Anyone want to guess? Proudly. Somebody want to guess? What your average click through rate actually looks like? Anyone? No wants to guess? I'll say it. 2%. 2%? No. , my God, I could go by a yacht with 2% 0.15% 0.08.</p><p id="""">Very few people click. Of the people that </p><p id="""">are reached, a minuscule amount actually click. So if you're an agency like Whalar, or anyone else, who wants to be a big boy and go and work with big brands. Or Gal. Yeah, let's not judge this at all. You need to be able to tell the story in the ROI of the 99. 8 percent that saw the content and we got no data on that.</p><p id="""">That's what this is going to do, right? It's going to give you the actual memory of that brand. So you can see here that those creators that </p><p id="""">were in that kind of, up near that top right hand quadrant, they're the ones that were doing really well. Now if you're in the top left corner, that means you're getting really good attention.</p><p id="""">So your story is good. It's standing out. Your first five seconds is eye catching. But if you're too far to the left, You're not getting that brand into memory. And I've seen so many examples of a really great piece of content, but they just took too long to mention the brands took too long. And when you look at attention data, attention data is a curve.</p><p id="""">It goes down for every second that you're talking to your audience. So to admit you're losing people. So it sounds a little cynical, but you kind of got to elegantly get that brand in there pretty quick. If you want to maximize that actual reach that you're giving back to the brand. And secondly, that, that message has to have some kind of emotional weight to it.</p><p id="""">And this is where I pay huge respect to creators. You're the master storytellers. You know how to tell a story. You don't need a brand breathing down your neck, giving you a script, right? You know how to connect with your audience. And the best campaigns are the ones that are going to have just the right balance between what the brand knows that it needs,</p><p id="""">But giving all power to that creator to harness that, do it elegantly, do it in a way that's going to come across as authentic, and allow that true memory that comes from that emotional, arousal, sorry to use that word, scientific word, to get what we need for the brands.</p><p id="""">Because at the end of the day, the creator economy is blowing up. We've seen some great numbers from Jasmine here. However, For it to stay up and to continue to grow, it needs accountability and it needs to prove ROI. That's what it needs to do and that's where measurement comes in. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: I did warn you I was going to be passionate and I think we're delivering on that so far.</p><p id="""">We've talked now a lot about what is working and the fact that everything seems to be going up and to the right but what's not working? What have you seen? What have you heard? </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: Who are you asking? </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Both of you. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: What do you think, Jasmine? </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: Well, I think hearkening back to one of the points that you made, one of the big things that never works is forced product marketing.</p><p id="""">Right? And but I think a lot of brands have learned, At least some to some degree and given more creative freedom. I think it's very scary to say the words creative freedom But I think we also need to recognize that we're at this point where being a creator being an influencer is a career These are professionals.</p><p id="""">They're not out there To get you or to make a mistake. This is also how they learn, earn a living, right? And so they want to do a good job, and they want to help you as a brand to reach audiences and sell your products. And so I think that conception needs to change and marketers do need to give a little bit more freedom to creators to be able to tell their story and do it in a way that resonates with with the audience.</p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Anything to add, Hamish? </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: Plenty. We've only got one minute left. Do we really only </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: have one minute </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: left? Do we? </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Oh. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: I'm just looking at the timer there. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Sorry. Okay. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: That's alright. Okay. We were worried we were going to run out of time. Scrap </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: this. Scrap this. Okay. Really quickly, in 30 seconds each, if you're a brand, what advice would you give a brand, we're going to start with you, in terms of how you would collaborate and co create with creators to help grow their business?</p><p id="""">Thanks. </p><p id="""">Jasmine Enberg, VP &amp;amp; Principal Analyst, EMARKETER: One, I think stop looking at vanity metrics and actually look at the audience first that you're trying to reach and find creators, that speak to that audience and to focus on long term relationships, bring the creators into the process early, make them feel accountable to the brand and to the campaigns that they're working on.</p><p id="""">And I think that will help improve all the campaigns and activations going forward. </p><p id="""">Jo Cronk, President, Whalar: Hamish, you got 20 seconds. </p><p id="""">Hamish McPharlin, Managing Director, Element Human: I will say, um Find real lovers of your brand, because I think [00:30:00] authenticity is everything. Real lovers of your brand, users of your brand, they're the ones that are going to, that authenticity is going to shine through and our data definitely shows.</p><p id="""">Authenticity is important, I know we talk about it a lot, it really, at a scientific level, translates to real brand success. Use trusted agencies, they didn't pay me to say that, who really understand, A, how to work with creators, but also how to measure them as well. And let the, let the cooks do the cookin Let those creators do their thing.</p><p id="""">They understand their audiences. They're the masters.

I appreciate you inviting us to Crossover AI. I'm calling in from across the pond over in Europe, but I spend half my time here and half the time in Victoria. It's a really, really interesting time for the artificial intelligence field. We've gotten to a point where machines can recognize a lot of things.</p><p id="""">And the area that I'm going to focus on today is around recognizing human beings, specifically emotions and behaviors. I come from about a 16 year background in, people measurement systems and I'm trying to understand working with actually Angus Reed before that in the Department of Human Kinetics at the University of British Columbia.</p><p id="""">And I'm really, really fascinated with the interaction between people and machines and specifically what can machines understand about us that we don't necessarily pick up ourselves. Or even more importantly, is there ways that machines can serve us in a more empathetic way? And we, we built our business element human under this core belief that emotions and behaviors are the connective tissue between what people experience and what they do.</p><p id="""">And today we're going to get into some of the, let's call them hard earned lessons. over the last seven years of working with people data while artificial intelligence was going from support vector machines to CNNs and further on into other areas now and how that's improving the capability to understand people at scale.</p><p id="""">and speed of performance data that company is dealing with today. Just to give you a bit of background on who we are and why we should even bother chatting and listening to us. We're a human experience intelligence platform. And I think, I just want to unpack that a little bit. Human experience to us is, is the mechanism of which people interact with other things, be it human beings, be a technology throughout their life.</p><p id="""">And the experience starts with them entering an environment. having an experience and leaving the environment to ultimately do something related to that experience. Experiences form our memories, they form our actions and behaviors, they form our perceptions of society, and they're really, really good indicators on how we're going to behave and act and receive the world in the future.</p><p id="""">So we built this with an idea of, well, with about seven years ago, and 2. 5 billion data points. We're collecting and activating sensors on devices like webcams to understand where people are looking and how they're feeling. And are they enacting any body language that we, we would normally capture face to face.</p><p id="""">But now when people buy online, they're not buying face to face anymore. They're buying through a machine. So how do we understand that? We did it in a safe way and consensual way with over 500 people across 89 countries. I can also tell you that we've learned a few things and we've learned them the hard way.</p><p id="""">What's really fascinating for us is just simply about this cycle of the human experience. When you start and enter an experience, let's call this an environment. So this could be a room, this could be a car, this could be a digital experience, and in digital there's all kinds of different ones. There is virtual reality through to simply a website or video.</p><p id="""">Right now a lot of companies are moving and migrating into this digital economy, specifically trying to create end to end customer experiences. And in their view, they have to create this experience as a, as a, an attraction, a location for you to go to, to pay attention to something. Once it grabs your attention, you then think about it, hopefully right to memory.</p><p id="""">And when you remember it, you act upon it, or you have a higher chance of acting upon it at their conversion level. So normally in, in back of the 2000s, you, you would kind of, if you wanted to buy a product, you'd go to a store and buy a product. It was the world of, of, of retailers. And then it turned into the world of brand.</p><p id="""">You became loyal to someone like Apple, and now it's turning into the world of e commerce. This end to end customer experience, direct to consumer, as they say. But you can't act if you can't remember. You can't remember if you didn't engage, and you can't engage if you can't experience. And a lot of our digital platforms tell us how we behave.</p><p id="""">Did we click on it? Did we buy something? How much? They also tell us if we entered the, the experience and how long we spent there, or even where we're looking and, and clicking on, on the screen. What they don't tell us is though why people are doing what they're doing. How did I feel about it? And what type of body language and human behavior do I exhibit during the experience?</p><p id="""">And this is what marketers and CEOs use to optimize their experience and strategy. So we broke that down and put it into a technology stack using artificial intelligence and parts and frankly using just good old form and coding [00:05:00] surveys to be able to start asking questions and capturing human data in a curated way that it was machine learnable against performance data.</p><p id="""">So this is when we talk about the human experience platform. This is the type of data that we collect here and we got experience. Identity, who you are, attention, where you're looking, what's capturing your attention, emotion, what does, how do you feel about it, what's engaging, memory, did this improve or, or, or increase or decrease your memory, and your affinity towards a brand or, or towards whatever the activity is, thought, how'd you feel about it?</p><p id="""">Tell us, how did you process that and logically feel about it? What did you do as an action? And then of course, how did that drive revenue or how did that drive learning or how did that drive safety? whatever the final metric might be. So we came into three considerations for human artificial intelligence, that we've learned over this time in the seven years.</p><p id="""">But we come across these all the time and they're constantly at the core of our business. So today is more about sharing a few war stories on why these considerations exist and why they should exist with anybody building an artificial intelligence solution for the future. So first one is individual versus universal, second one is open versus closed, and the third one is people versus profit.</p><p id="""">Let's go into individual versus universal. In a lot of the artificial intelligence capabilities, when you're building these types of recognition systems, or when you're looking to apply them, you're taking some sort of algorithm that's been limited by some sort of training set. And the transferability of that training is dependent on what the use case is, how similar it is to the training set, and of course, in other cases, how well your algorithms can learn and adapt.</p><p id="""">In the emotion space, for years, psychology and science was very much built around this idea of universal emotion classification. Everybody who smiled was happy. We weren't seeing that. We weren't seeing that at the very beginning, and so we had to start doing a lot of studies around how do we build much better recognition.</p><p id="""">And not only were we not seeing that, we were seeing a lot of misfires. There was a lot of, false positives and false negatives going on in that people would appear very sad, but they weren't actually quite sad. In fact, at half the time, they were smiling. So, so why were they registering sad? And so we had to ask these types of questions.</p><p id="""">Ultimately, about five years later, there was a really good paper published by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett reviewing a thousand different approaches, in academia around universal facial expressions, not finding any consistency. for listening. Which proves kind of our internal data set where we found and had already refactored towards an individual based approach.</p><p id="""">But here's how we would test for something like that. We work with people like Bear Grylls to be able to show the world a very defined emotional piece of content. Which I'm going to play for you here.</p><p id="""">Ready for this?</p><p id="""">Oh my goodness,</p><p id="""">this one has been living in there. A very, very long time. I'm not going to need to eat for a week after this.</p><p id="""">Pound for pound, insects like these contain more protein than beef or fish. They're perfect survival food. </p><p id="""">Matt Celuszak: So as you can see there, I have quite a disgusting video. And that whole emotional state was a more humorous disgust. What's fascinating, and I've used this video a number of times for demonstrations, people react differently.</p><p id="""">So if you're watching this with somebody else, take a look at how they react and think about how you're reacting. Did you cover your mouth? Did you lean back and smile? Did you look disgusted or fear? These are all different reactions that everybody has to this particular type of content. And they're all equally valid because they're all based on the individual.</p><p id="""">But what it more exposed was on the false negative side. We put this head to head against a big tech algorithm that is out there on the market today being used across a number of different, industries in a universal capacity. And ours is in blue, which uses an individual approach, and theirs is in orange using a universal approach.</p><p id="""">And what you can see here is Real world data, first of all, is quite messy. It doesn't look anything like your training data from a lab. So you have to get out there and get real world data.</p><p id="""">So in this case, if there's an orange box that appears. That's the big tech algorithm. The [00:10:00] blue box is an individual algorithm that we've created. So simply by going from individual, from the universal approach to classification, we're able to eliminate a number of issues. Another, another big one, which unfortunately caught me by surprise.</p><p id="""">I was doing a meeting with, the largest, media company in the world, with their senior executives on their news side. And, and we were going on the room and I was demonstrating the technology and each individual person was trying it out to see how it read their face live. And, that was the first time we learned that, computer recognition systems don't do very well with black skin or dark skin faces.</p><p id="""">I can assure you, it was the most embarrassing moment of my life. And, as a scientist and, and the way that we look into our stuff, we went to try and fix it and learned a number of things. And, It was really nice to see in this new data set that we were able to create being able to crack that challenge.</p><p id="""">The challenge is actually one of both classifications are often skewed towards upper class or wealthier societies and, and often skewed towards academia, in which case you're dealing with very, very biased training data sets. So if you're going to be building artificial intelligence for a better world beyond, it has to be inclusive and you have to think about it that way.</p><p id="""">And so we're quite happy about how this one turned out. And that again, orange would be, so you're seeing red here, red means that there was no recognition at all, and orange would be when the standard algorithm that's used by a lot of the world today. We'll be using it and they wouldn't even find a face inside this video.</p><p id="""">So now you've eliminated people with beards and you've eliminated dark skin people. So you've got rid of about, you know, a third to two thirds of the world. So then the next question is what happens with people who don't have full, really high quality video coming at you as well. And this one has to, this video had a pretty low bit rate.</p><p id="""">And again, what you're seeing is very, very low recognition of even finding the face. So if you're looking at computer vision recognition systems, yes people love to advertise, it's huge, it's scalable, but you got to get real right into the details. So in this case, That big tech algorithm head to head just wouldn't even perform on more than 10 percent of the population.</p><p id="""">So the challenges that you have around when you're thinking about individual versus universal building artificial intelligence systems is real world data is messy. So if you're going to train anything and you want an algorithm that's usable, you want to apply it properly and have it be usable across more use cases, you have to worry about the trainability and transferability.</p><p id="""">So you need to get out of the lab and train on real world data. get into the use case. For us, we learned that universal classifiers and emotion are not applicable universally. And there's two ways to solve this. One way is very much to boil the ocean. Try and measure everybody on the planet and therefore you'll be able to build an individual algorithm for everyone on the planet or at least classify people by their cultural sets.</p><p id="""">That's making a huge assumption around cultures. There's been a lot of international travel for many years. Living in the UK, living in Canada, we've got two of the most diverse countries in the world. And yet, how can we possibly say that a male 34 years old is the same as another male 34 years old? I think we have to be really careful with those types of algorithms.</p><p id="""">And then the first, the final one is. What is happy to one person is not happy to another. Everybody operates differently. We talk about this in stereotypes. Brits don't smile. Americans are over happy. But when we actually did a global study around this, it wasn't isolated to the country you were from.</p><p id="""">In fact, there was no correlation to that. It was very much clustered by people who were just more emotionally expressive versus those that weren't. So the key here was, was how do we baseline against an individual? And ultimately on this one, it's about then taking it to the edge. We'll talk about privacy in a moment.</p><p id="""">The second thing that came up in our company, that's a guiding principle that we find very interesting when building for tomorrow for a better human based tomorrow is this theme around open versus closed. We took a, one of the challenges with building proprietary IP is that everybody gets caught up, particularly as a founder, your shareholders, your, your employees all get caught up on.</p><p id="""">You got to keep, you got to keep the secret sauce behind the cloak. [00:15:00] And we've actually found quite the opposite. We kept it behind the cloak for a while and weren't able to drive a lot of revenues. And the moment I started, I started hosting what I call the wood panel and wine rooms. And basically I just rented the top floor of a British pub and we hosted people around.</p><p id="""">It was a round table session where we'd have about 15, 20 people. And what we would do is we would simply just talk about, here's the big issues that we want to solve. And we have something called Chatham House Rules, which means that you can talk about anything you want, and you can leave and express some of the ideas, but you can't reference who it came from.</p><p id="""">This allowed us to create an open environment to talk to, people who were in competing businesses, competing CMOs, and lay out the real challenges that they're facing. It validated our product proposition and our product market fit, but it also opened up a lot of business for us. And I think what the interesting thing about artificial intelligence is, There are a lot of people who know a lot about AI, but when it comes to artificial intelligence and applying it properly in a business, it has to be configured to your business.</p><p id="""">And ultimately, it's a people solution. So if you are going to serve artificial intelligence to your customers, and that's going to be a value proposition of your business, whether you're building it from a core level of, of the, how do you make CNNs better, and, and provide improvement there all the way through to the application of it.</p><p id="""">You have to consider who that end user is, and ultimately it's about empowering them. AI is a tool. It's a means to an end. And we found that by opening up, we were able to open up a lot of things and it raised a lot more concerns for us that we were allowed to address early on, which put us in a strong position when GDPR hit.</p><p id="""">So for us, the first bit was seeing is believing for a lot of people. So showing them the science and more importantly, talking about these stories that we're sharing with you today, talking about the pain points, Yeah, when we were using support vector machines on a universal classifier, we were misfiring more than we were firing.</p><p id="""">It was not great. And you can imagine that, you know, similar to like launching rockets, first bunch of crash and burn. And so it was a little bit tough. So we had to open that up and foster the discussion. And it only helped us build a much stronger client base. and a much stronger growth path for our business.</p><p id="""">So make your science accessible. It's my first recommendation on that one. And we live by that now. Smart people have good ideas. Another bit here was by bringing that, that, that round table together, you foster really, really good ideas. We now do this virtually using a mirror board. It's fantastic. It's a great, great tool.</p><p id="""">And you just get online and there's a, there's a really good template from Disney, you know, getting people into a dreamer state, realistic state. and then into a critic state and be able to pick apart really good ideas. But by fostering that open culture, you get much better results and much more diversified and inclusive results.</p><p id="""">The other one is about AI impacting everyone. If you're going to build an artificial intelligence system, we learned very quickly that actually our customer is not just the business we're serving for market intelligence. or for improving education, it's the student whose education and frankly their grades rely on being able to get taught properly.</p><p id="""">So it's about making that accessible for everyone and that can be done in a number of ways technically speaking but also just again from an education standpoint. In the artificial intelligence realm you're going to be the expert so make sure that you help people understand that and be open to the discussion and be open to being wrong.</p><p id="""">And having to change your view. The other thing for us when it comes to computer recognition and vision technologies is consent is not a barrier. It's not something to be overcome. It's a way of life. Accept it. Be part of it. Give people a good reason to engage with you and your artificial intelligence.</p><p id="""">Artificial intelligence is scary for a lot of people. But what we've learned over the last seven years is When we started explaining our consent and giving people the option to opt in to, for research, or opt in and not ever be seen by a human being, strictly be using the algorithms, or not opt in at all, we actually saw a 13 percent opt in rate and 80 percent of people who opted in actually opted in for research and further, further use.</p><p id="""">What was interesting about that is over the last seven years in the market research field, that opt in rate has already grown to about 26, 27 percent. So we're seeing people opt in where they see value. And I think that you have to understand the value exchange with the individual if you're going to serve an organization.</p><p id="""">The final one that we're going to talk about is people versus profit. And I almost lost my company over this one. I was chasing, one of the largest sports broadcasters in the world, and they had a really, really [00:20:00] cool project that I've always wanted to do. I've always thought, you know, poker players, they don't have a coach kind of like, kind of like track all stars and athletes do.</p><p id="""">So when I was in human kinetics, we would use VO2 max monitors and chest monitors to be able to understand and anticipate performance coming down. For for long distance runners. And, in this case, it was sports broadcast and it was about how how do we monitor, you know, some of the sports and some of the pro athletes out there.</p><p id="""">The Tiger Woods is Roger Federer is those types of people in the world. How do we monitor the performance of what emotional state they're in? So we can feed that back. And it was a fascinating, challenge. I can tell you the amount of tonnage going through our algorithm was obscene. This client would have been more than a million pounds a year, and frankly would have made us as an organization.</p><p id="""">We would never have had to look for money again. And so we started to get into scoping and it turned out though that they were going to repurpose the information to be used to improve betting odds for betting houses. We liked the use case for mental capacity with athletes. It didn't feel right to be able to manipulate people.</p><p id="""">In that sense, it's a very powerful piece of technology. And you have to be really, really careful with that. So for us, we actually had to say no. and scrounge. We had to scrounge, we had to take pay cuts and we had to figure out how to hit the next milestone. That was two years ago. So, we're here and we're growing and, and I have to say I'm very proud of that.</p><p id="""">We're very proud of that aspect. So when you're thinking about people versus profits, that's the one that set us along the side of ethics. But I've also seen a lot of, a lot of talk and a lot of attempt at implementing an ethics committee. Yeah. Ethics have to be owned at the decision level. Yes, a committee is good for having a body there and demonstrating publicly that it's there.</p><p id="""">But a true organization is going to have ethical value sitting within the character development and hiring of their people. And I think that has to fundamentally sit with the responsibility of the CEO. And, and it has to be in a, in that individual personal conflict with driving shareholder value, particularly today and particularly with the new markets that are coming up.</p><p id="""">If you don't have relevance in the world tomorrow and you can't prove that to the markets that are going to be using your stuff, I think you're going to have a really tough time even realizing your long term profits. The second bit around it, it was around just nobody wants a 4 million euro fine.</p><p id="""">GDPR was a right, right, just kick in the right direction, in our view from a people measurement standpoint. I, I consult a lot with the UK government and the around how to direct the digital guidelines. Around privacy. And for us, the real challenge for a business and for you if you're you're building an artificial intelligence business is how do I create something that is universally applicable so I can have one set of terms that are maybe localized a little bit, but also be able to transfer the types of rights and ethos that we want to to the individual.</p><p id="""">And so for us, we just took a really hard individual approach. It didn't only comply with GDPR, but we're also a Canadian company as well. So we had to comply with GDPR. with PIPA and some of the Canadian practices as well, and South Korean practices, which just got rewritten. And we've decided that rather than try to just comply with guidelines that are out there, Really think the problem through from an individual perspective so that if it ever landed in court, if the individual rights are always put before the organization, and it's gonna be pretty hard to prove that you're in the wrong and the wrong side of data, privacy and protection.</p><p id="""">So that's how we handle our data privacy. And, and, that again was a hard learned lesson. Going from, going from a, you know, we could use all the data we want to, we actually had to delete. We had to delete over 2 billion data points. Because the consent wording wasn't exactly up to snuff the way we wanted to the earth from in the early days when GDPR came in.</p><p id="""">So it was a hard lesson. And then the final bit is a question of the impact. I think the biggest thing that I'd like to leave you with is saying no to get to the right yes. We found this to be really, really incredible tactic internally and externally of helping us find really good clients. We put our clients through a KYC process.</p><p id="""">They need to understand the impact of the data that they're having. And, and, and that they're using. And so when you're building for tomorrow, it's really taking a partnership approach and, and not being afraid to say, no, yes, you're going to be the mouse on the shoulder of elephants. [00:25:00] That's fine. But you're also the expert.</p><p id="""">And if you're that expert, you're truly that expert, you'll be able to define that expertise and they'll respect that expertise. So say the right no's to get to yes, to make sure that whatever you deliver is going to be a really, really solid solution that benefits everybody. It will be impacted. So I think that's all I have for you to share with you today.</p><p id="""">Thank you very much for inviting me over to crossover AI. And if you have any questions whatsoever, just fire them over into the chat. I really appreciate it. And we're on this massive human journey for us.

I'm your host, Hamish McFarlane, and today I'd like to talk about a new release from Element Human called Stopping and Stain Power. This is a new reporting feature that has been designed specifically to help brands and agencies quickly understand how their social or creative campaign is going.</p><p id="""">It's proven particularly popular with influencer agencies for a very particular reason, and I'd like to explore that and also take you under the hood to show you how it works. Before we do, I think it's important to to first get some background on how Element Human's measurement actually works. So let's quickly dive into that and then see how our measurement has unearthed a problem that stopping and staying power has been designed to solve.</p><p id="""">This is essentially the way that Element Human does its testing. We test all kinds of digital advertising, but social media is particularly where our system is quite powerful and the reason is it's a test that is in context of a social media feed. So whether that's TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube shorts, it is going to be able to gather metrics on the impact of each of the creatives in your campaign and how it's performing in the feed, which are essentially a four part methodology.</p><p id="""">So the first one is attention. Our system is going to measure the attention of the target audience in the feed. How many seconds they're spending looking at the post. It's going to use a camera. Obviously, it's going to get their consent before it does so. And it's going to gather that attention data. You can see the heat map on the right hand side there.</p><p id="""">So that's one of the particular aspects of attention that we're measuring there. But we also have something we call attention in feed, which is part of the stopping and staying power calculation. So I'm going to show you that later. At the same time that we're observing the face to gather attention data on where people are looking and how long they're looking for.</p><p id="""">We're also gathering data on their emotional state using something called facial coding. Are they smiling? Are they feeling surprised? Are they feeling sadness? We're really interested in getting right down to the creative level and seeing what makes great content. Bottom left there. This is a third part of our methodology called brand memory.</p><p id="""">This is called an implicit association test. Probably do a whole episode on that another time. But what it's really measuring there. Is whether the brand that has been observed, has that brand gotten itself into the memory of the audience? Will they remember it? Don't forget, not every product is designed to be purchased as soon as you see it added.</p><p id="""">Most advertising needs to be memory banked to be purchased at a later date. Particularly if you're a car brand, travel brands, finance brands, not everything is an instant product for an instant click, so brand memory is really important and is often a substantially overlooked part of methodology. And bottom right is something that is pretty common in measurement of campaigns and creatives, which is called Brand Uplift.</p><p id="""">So this is essentially a test and control methodology, where we have a sample of an audience who see the advertising in the feed. We have a sample who do not. We ask them a whole bunch of questions about the brand, their awareness of it. whether they like it, whether they would consider it in a buying situation, whether they would purchase it.</p><p id="""">And then we essentially compare the results and the differences between the exposed group and then control group who didn't see anything are our uplift. And that essentially tells us was their movement in awareness of the brand and the other metrics as a result of seeing that particular content in the feed.</p><p id="""">So that's essentially how the element human test works. Now, It's quite comprehensive, as you can see. And one of the interesting things about it is it shows not just what works in advertising, but what doesn't work. And one of the things that sort of showed us in the last couple of years is this, which is a real problem around attention.</p><p id="""">Problem with attention is we see time and time again, particularly in the creator and influencer marketing space, just because you got a lot of attention does not mean the brand cut through. And don't forget when you move into creative marketing and influencer marketing, you're now moving into an area where you're not really in control of the storyboarding anymore.</p><p id="""">When you work with creators, they are now the storytellers, they are now the producer, the writer. Um, and you know, brands, of course, want to make sure that they're controlling that as much as possible. You kind of can't because creators. Are the [00:04:00] storytellers for their audiences and you kind of got to let them do it.</p><p id="""">So there is this interesting conundrum now, which is that creators can do a great job of getting attention, but that doesn't mean they nailed the brand cut through and we will see situations like the one you can see on the screen right now, a lot, which is a credit. I got a lot of attention in the feed.</p><p id="""">It was eye catching. It was exciting and people watched it. But when you looked at. What was the brand that the creator was talking about? There was all sorts of issues. And actually a lot of cases it was creator B that actually did a better job of it. And so if all you do is look at attention, you're not actually getting the real story.</p><p id="""">At the end of the day is all the eyeballs in the world are great, but not if they're not able to get that brand into memory. So it's getting right down to the real ROI that brands are asking for. Now, let's talk about creative. If you talk to agencies about what's important in measurement, you might hear, as I do, that actually the creative is not very important.</p><p id="""">It doesn't actually matter if, uh, an ad is good or bad. The real lever is how much money you put behind it. Where you put it. So it's all about media planning. I hear this a lot. And feel free to jump in the comments and argue on this if you like, I would love to have a discussion about this, but I do hear quite a lot that the creative is kind of just an asset.</p><p id="""">It's not actually very important when it comes down to the real ROI. I think this is wrong. And there's a study that I'm showing you here from Nielsen in 2017. Based on 500 campaigns that measured all the variables that go into advertising across a lot of digital formats. It looked at the contribution of the creative itself, the actual quality of that creative in the driving of the ROI against that ad spend.</p><p id="""">And the creative actually is number one. It was 47%. I've seen some other meta studies that have it about 40. The answer is still the same. The creative is a lot more important that I think agencies give it credit for. I think the reason that it's minimized is because they don't have good measurement on it.</p><p id="""">There isn't good ways to measure the power of individual creators, and that's why it's kind of left out. People know about the levers that they can pull. They can pull the cost lever, they can pull the budget lever, they can pull the placement lever. We need to appreciate and measure the quality of creatives because they are a number one contributor to ROI.</p><p id="""">More so with influencer and creator marketing, I think this is even more important. We all know about the window of attention that we have with audience these days is tiny. You have a few seconds of people's time. Your Creative has to stand out in the infinite scroll. It has to gather attention to stop people in their tracks.</p><p id="""">And so this is really the groundwork for where stopping and staying power came from. It was sort of identifying these problems and really thinking about the power of the creator and the creative and how important it is to measure that. Stopping and staying power came about through the kind of conversations that we have with our clients, many of whom are influencer agencies, and it really boiled down to, can we just answer these two questions?</p><p id="""">Is the content stopping people in their tracks? Yes, but as we saw a little earlier, we also must know is the brand stopping Cutting through and getting into memory. If it's not doing that, the creative attention isn't worth what it, what it should be to the brand. So how do we do it? Well, stopping power is an attention metric.</p><p id="""">So we use our attention in feed score. This is how many seconds are being spent looking at the content in the feed, whether it's on Tik TOK, whether it's an Instagram, our system using the webcam and eye tracking is able to calculate that. We then rank it against the feed. The global benchmarks for that platform that we have, of which we have thousands.</p><p id="""">So that's stopping power. Now, as you can see, that is a top of the funnel metric, right? Then we have staying power. This is now about brand memory. Will your brand be remembered? This is a middle of the funnel metric. We are dealing with the engagement with the brand. We are creating an emotional connection to that brand and the implicit test, which tests brand memory is what's going to power this one.</p><p id="""">And I've put this little arrow here downwards. And the reason for that is that. Our data shows us that [00:08:00] doing better in the middle does drive lower funnel goals, such as purchase intent, and I'll show you evidence of that shortly. Okay, so the way we do it is we take our stopping power score and we take our staying power score and we Plot them out on an X and a Y axis.</p><p id="""">And then what we do is we show you where each of the creators videos are living. And the key here is that the higher you are across each of these axis axes, the better your ranking against those benchmarks. So if you are at the top, let's say. Up here, you're a superstar. You are performing above the benchmark for both stopping power and staying power.</p><p id="""">And trust me, not every creative video can do this. In fact, it's the real notable ones that are pulling it off. If you're in the top top box, you're in the top quartile. Each of these four boxes is quartile. So you're in the top 25 percent for stopping power and the top 25 percent for staying power for your platform on TikTok or Instagram, things like that.</p><p id="""">If you are over here, well, it means you are above average for stopping power, but you're below for staying power. So this is content that is eye catching, it's stopping people in their tracks in the feed, but it's actually not achieving brand cut through. So if creative number three over here, That's an interesting one for us, right?</p><p id="""">We would now look at that inside the campaign and say, okay, this is a creator that's doing a great job of getting attention, but it's actually not overt enough about the brand. Is it mentioning the brand? Is it showing the brand? Is it showing the product? Is it taking too long to talk about the brand?</p><p id="""">I've definitely seen situations where The brand cut through didn't work because the creator took too long to mention the brand. And if you take too long, you're losing attention. Don't forget, attention over time is a curve. As the seconds tick by, less of your audience is still there, right? So you kind of need to elegantly get the brand in early at the top of that curve.</p><p id="""">In the first, you know, let's say 5 or 10 seconds when your audience is at its maximum. Then conversely, we've got The opposite issue, if you're a creative is falling into this little blue pocket down here, what's this telling us? Well, it's telling us that our staying power is good. So now here we have a very high results for brand memory, but stopping power is underperforming.</p><p id="""">This means that the content is not so much standing at the feed. It's got more of a niche audience, but for that audience, it's doing a great job. So it's, it is, uh, the. Other side of the coin really in that it's not getting attention, but it is getting brand memory. So that's kind of how it works. And if you take a look at it as stopping a staying power chart, it would look like this.</p><p id="""">So in this particular campaign, you might have eight creatives here. They are mapped and you can see the stopping power is the what we call a percentile rank against our attention in feed score. And you can see that it is divided up by platforms. So in this particular case, you've got some green and some pink dots.</p><p id="""">The green ones are TikTok creatives, and that's how they rank against the TikTok benchmarks. And then Instagram has the Instagram creatives there in the pink, and that's how they rank against the Instagram creative. So that's stopping and staying power. So we needed to validate this against that data.</p><p id="""">And of course, because we have so much, we're able to do that. So the first one was as you move up the quartiles of your stopping power score, What does that do to awareness of your brand? And we're happy to say that as you move up those quartiles, we see a very direct and linear movement in the positive direction for awareness.</p><p id="""">You can see as you do better at stopping power and move up those quartiles, you can expect Better top of the funnel performance and similarly for staying power as you move along the quartiles for brand memory, you can enjoy better intention to purchase your product no matter what platform you're on.</p><p id="""">You can expect a, uh, uplift in purchasing intent of about 43 percent or so, but the evidence is there that doing better on the stopping and staying power chart has real meaningful results at key parts of the funnel. So we have on our website a place for you to go and play to explore the stopping and staying power chart.</p><p id="""">So if you go to elementhuman.com, you'll get to see something we call the SSP Superchart, which we make [00:12:00] available to our clients. So you can see, first of all, you can turn on and off some of your creatives, so by platform. So if you want to turn off Facebook and TikTok and YouTube shorts and just see your Instagram, there you go.</p><p id="""">Jacques Cousteau with Wacky Upstart Brand is the top performer on Instagram for this particular agency. All right, I'm going to turn those back on. Um, and then the other thing is that, you know, I can choose, for instance, the beauty category, or I can choose entertainment and streaming. And it's going to basically show me, uh, all of the tests that I've ever done inside that category.</p><p id="""">So I can understand who are my top creators inside the category that I can then put forward for my new pitch, um, or my renewal or anything like that. The second one is I can look at my creators so we can take a look at how they have performed across the various campaigns that they have been running as creators.</p><p id="""">What categories are they best at? What categories are they driving the best results at? And the other one is, of course, brand. The idea here is you can, as an agency, take a look at your testing that you've done for that particular brand and you can see how have we delivered for them and what other creators that have delivered for them.</p><p id="""">over campaigns to give them what we're looking for and to help us optimize and learn over time what makes great content, what makes creative content enduring, compelling, exciting, memorable, and what are the secrets to success for creators inside a category. And of course, you've got country, so you could divide it up by various markets to see what, what other content that are working in a particular market and of course, month and year.</p><p id="""">So hopefully this has been a good example of stopping and staying power. We consider this kind of a brand performance currency. Um, so if you would like to read up more about it, you can go to element human. com and follow the links through to SSP. Uh, you can have a play around with it just as I've done now.</p><p id="""">Thank you for your time and see you on the next episode of Elementally Human.</p>",,Fri Nov 08 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

As consumer viewing habits continue their rapid shift, Connected TV (CTV) is no longer just an emerging trend; <strong id="""">it's solidifying its position as a dominant force in the media landscape</strong>. For advertising and creative agencies, understanding and mastering CTV is not just an opportunity – it's an essential requirement to remain competitive and deliver real value to clients. At Element Human, we believe that as CTV advertising explodes, brands need to find the right platform that reaches the right audience with a compelling, engaging story while ensuring their brand's message cuts through.</p><p id="""">CTV, encompassing smart TVs, streaming devices like Roku and Apple TV, and gaming consoles that access internet video content, is fundamentally reshaping how audiences consume media. This transformation is fueled by cord-cutting habits and the rise of streaming services with ad-supported tiers. Advertising spend on CTV is surging, projected to reach $33.35 billion in the US in 2025 and potentially $48 billion globally, with forecasts showing it surpassing traditional TV ad spend within the next few years. This dramatic rise signifies that brands across industries are moving significant budgets to CTV, recognizing its proven returns.</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/683a3d33018d16b7410bff21_what-is-ctv-advertising-infographic-410x1024.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/683a3aca48e51a734c7f5bce_351713.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Rise of Performance TV: Challenging the Giants</strong></h3><p id="""">One of the most significant narratives surrounding CTV in 2025 is its emergence as a potent performance marketing channel, capable of rivaling giants like Google and Meta. For years, advertisers gravitated towards digital platforms for their perceived performance advantages and granular measurement, often feeling they couldn't give up on TV's impact but lacked comparable measurement. Now, CTV promises to combine the brand-building power of TV with the measurability of digital.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/683a3c5c0a08bf4246127e36_MNTN-Research-Peeks-Report-May-2023_Graph-1-1024x658.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">The reasons cited for CTV's performance potential are compelling:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Superior Ad Format:</strong> Compared to traditional programmatic offerings like display and online video (OLV), the CTV ad format is significantly superior. With high viewability rates (around 99%), large screen format, sound, and high completion rates (over 95%), CTV offers a premium, immersive viewing experience that ensures the ad is seen and heard with 100% share of screen. This contrasts sharply with display ad viewability standards which can be drastically lower.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Enhanced User Engagement:</strong> This superior format drives superior user engagement, which in turn drives performance. While proving this connection was difficult previously, advancements have made it possible recently.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Improved Measurement and Attribution:</strong> TV attribution measurement and analytics have advanced significantly. On some platforms, these tools are more transparent and verifiable than those offered by Google or Facebook, providing marketers with greater control. Advertisers can now deterministically connect TV ad exposure to outcomes like sales and measure incremental ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) at a granular level. This is becoming less feasible on platforms like the Google Display Network and Facebook.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ease of Use:</strong> Self-serve CTV buying and measurement tools are becoming available that are reportedly easier to use than search and social interfaces, offering better transparency and control.</li></ul><p id="""">Given these factors, some anticipate Performance TV not only attracting advertisers away from Facebook and Google but even surpassing search as a performance channel within 5-7 years, a transition that is already underway. Advertisers are increasing CTV budgets faster than other digital formats, signaling a fundamental change in how brands reach consumers.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/683a3bd130ccb7100467cd2d_Us-TV-and-Connected-TV-Graph-1024x481.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Navigating the Challenges in 2025</strong></h3><p id="""">Despite the significant opportunities, the CTV landscape in 2025 is not without its challenges. Agencies and marketers must be prepared to navigate these complexities:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Measurement and Attribution:</strong> While measurement tools have improved, effectively tracking and analyzing campaigns across a fragmented ecosystem remains a concern for many industry leaders. Different platforms and reporting approaches can make unified measurement challenging. Agencies need robust solutions and expertise to provide a holistic view of performance.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Scale vs. Fragmentation:</strong> Linear TV's primary advantage was its unparalleled scale. As audiences shift to various streaming services and devices, reaching that same broad scale requires navigating a more fragmented environment.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cost:</strong> CTV advertising rates are generally higher than traditional linear TV impressions or online video. While advocates argue the value proposition is superior due to targeting and engagement, the higher CPMs mean performance must be proportionally better. Premium inventory can be particularly costly, potentially challenging for smaller businesses.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ad Fraud:</strong> Ad fraud remains a leading concern in the CTV space. Agencies must work with trusted partners and platforms to ensure inventory quality.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Audience Saturation and Fatigue:</strong> As ad spend increases, there's a risk of repeating the ""Cable Channel Experience"" with too many commercial breaks, leading to ad fatigue. Effective frequency capping and managing audience overlap are crucial.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Lack of Buyer Education:</strong> Some advertisers and agencies are still reliant on older methods or lack the understanding needed to fully leverage targeted CTV inventory.

Ads should feature clear narratives and consider emotion alongside audio and safe areas from the conceptualization stage.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Relevance and Personalization:</strong> The advanced targeting capabilities mean ads can be tailored to specific audience segments based on behavior, interests, or viewing habits. Creative should be high-quality and tailored to the audience's interests and viewing habits. Adding useful content like weather updates or sports scores can increase viewer attention.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Testing and Optimization:</strong> Agencies can test subtle variations in ad creative to see what resonates most with the audience and impacts performance. This allows for iterative improvements and refining creative elements for maximum impact.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Integrating Creators:</strong> Newer channels like CTV are providing monetization opportunities for creators, and some companies are exploring ways to run creator content alongside traditional ads on CTV platforms.</li></ul><p id="""">The convergence of CTV and retail media in 2025 also opens doors for more custom and engaging creative focused on driving conversions rather than just brand equity.

Train teams, explore programmatic platforms, and develop specific CTV strategies before competitors do. This expertise helps small to mid-sized agencies stay competitive and strengthen client relationships.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Prioritize Data and Measurement:</strong> A data-centric strategy is crucial for overcoming challenges and positioning agencies to lead. Invest in robust measurement solutions that provide a holistic view across channels. Analyze data granularly by audience segment, geoperformance, creative, and strategy to optimize campaigns.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Integrate Cross-Platform Strategies:</strong> CTV should not be treated as an isolated channel. Develop cohesive strategies that integrate CTV with linear TV (where relevant for older audiences), digital, search, and social touchpoints for a unified brand experience and cross-channel attribution.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Focus on Performance Outcomes:</strong> Clients increasingly need performance marketing outcomes that balance creative solutions with strategic initiatives. Agencies must demonstrate ROI and connect CTV exposure directly to business results like sales or conversions. Interactive and shoppable ads are key to turning CTV into a conversion engine.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Leverage First-Party Data and Privacy-First Approaches:</strong> With the decline of third-party cookies, first-party data and contextual targeting are becoming essential. Agencies that master privacy-compliant strategies will gain a significant advantage.</li></ul><p id="""">For small to mid-sized independent agencies, technologies like CTV offer a secret weapon to stay competitive, scale their business offering, and compete directly with larger competitors.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Future is Connected</strong></h3><p id="""">The data clearly shows that Connected TV is undergoing a significant transformation.

Not all research panels are created equal, and what works brilliantly for one industry might fail spectacularly for another. This article introduces the Brand &amp; Product Category Fit Matrix—a strategic framework for evaluating which market research panel providers are best suited for different types of brands and product categories.</p><h2 id="""">Understanding the Fit Matrix Concept</h2><p id="""">The Fit Matrix is a systematic approach to evaluating the alignment between specific brand and product category characteristics and the capabilities of different market research panel providers. Rather than treating all research needs as identical, this framework acknowledges that different industries, product types, and brand positions require fundamentally different research approaches.</p><h3 id="""">Defining the Dimensions of Fit Assessment</h3><p id="""">The Fit Matrix evaluates alignment across several critical dimensions.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Audience Representation: How well does the provider's panel represent the target market for the brand or product category? This includes demographic coverage, behavioral characteristics, and psychographic profiles.</li><li id="""">Category Engagement: To what extent do panel members actively engage with the category in question? Panels strong in automotive enthusiasts, for instance, may be weak in financial services decision-makers.</li><li id="""">Purchase Cycle Alignment: How well does the panel's structure align with the purchase frequency and decision process for the category? Some panels excel at frequent purchase categories while others better serve high-consideration decisions.</li><li id="""">Expertise Depth: What level of category knowledge do panel members possess? Some categories require deeply knowledgeable respondents, while others primarily need general consumer perspectives.</li><li id="""">Methodological Fit: Do the provider's research capabilities match the methodological needs of the category? Some categories require specialized approaches that not all providers support effectively.</li></ul><h3 id="""">The Methodology Behind Fit Scoring</h3><p id="""">The Fit Matrix uses a systematic scoring approach across these dimensions. This methodical approach transforms what is often an intuitive or relationship-driven decision into a strategic evaluation based on objective criteria.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Quantitative Assessment: Each dimension is scored on a 1-5 scale based on objective criteria specific to the dimension.</li><li id="""">Weighted Importance: Dimensions are weighted based on their importance for specific research objectives, acknowledging that priorities vary by project.</li><li id="""">Composite Scoring: Individual dimension scores are combined into an overall fit score that ranges from ""Poor Fit"" to ""Ideal Fit.""</li><li id="""">Comparative Evaluation: Multiple providers are typically assessed simultaneously to identify relative strengths rather than absolute scores.</li></ul><h3 id="""">How to Interpret Fit Scores for Decision-Making</h3><p id="""">Fit scores should guide provider selection decisions but require thoughtful interpretation. These interpretations should inform not just whether to use a provider but also how to structure research to leverage strengths and mitigate limitations.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Ideal Fit (80-100%): The provider excels across all relevant dimensions and should be a primary consideration for the category.</li><li id="""">Strong Fit (60-79%): The provider performs well on most dimensions with minor limitations that can typically be addressed through project design.</li><li id="""">Moderate Fit (40-59%): The provider has significant strengths in some areas but notable weaknesses in others, requiring careful scope definition and limitation awareness.</li><li id="""">Weak Fit (20-39%): The provider has substantial limitations for the category but might be usable for specific narrowly defined projects with appropriate guardrails.</li><li id="""">Poor Fit (&lt;20%): The provider is fundamentally misaligned with category needs and should generally be avoided regardless of other factors like cost or convenience.</li></ul><h3 id="""">Benefits of a Systematic Approach to Provider Selection</h3><p id="""">The Fit Matrix approach offers several advantages over more intuitive selection methods. Organizations that implement systematic fit assessment typically report higher research satisfaction, more actionable insights, and better return on research investment.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Objective Evaluation: Reduces the influence of relationships, familiarity bias, and marketing effectiveness in provider selection.</li><li id="""">Consistent Assessment: Creates a standardized framework that can be applied across different research initiatives.</li><li id="""">Risk Reduction: Identifies potential misalignments before project investment rather than discovering them during execution.</li><li id="""">Knowledge Accumulation: Builds organizational understanding of provider strengths and limitations over time.</li><li id="""">Strategic Alignment: Ensures research partner selection supports broader business objectives rather than just project-specific needs.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5eb03fc50b6790f90f3d773c/6838dd2112c53b9e56bec9a8_fit_matrix.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id="""">Ideal Fit: Brand and Category Types</h2><p id="""">Certain brand and product categories naturally align with the capabilities of traditional market research panels. Understanding these ideal fits helps organizations leverage the full potential of panel research.</p><h3 id="""">Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG): The Perfect Research Match</h3><p id="""">CPG brands represent one of the best fits for traditional market research panels due to several key characteristics. These characteristics make CPG categories like food and beverage, household products, personal care, and over-the-counter medications particularly well-suited to panel research.

Yet as research budgets face increasing scrutiny, understanding the complex cost structures of panel providers has never been more critical. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of market research panel provider pricing in 2025, exploring the various models, cost drivers, and strategic approaches to maximizing research ROI.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Cost Structures and Pricing Models in 2025</strong></h2><p id="""">The market research industry employs several distinct pricing models, each with different implications for budgeting, flexibility, and value. Understanding these models is essential for effective research planning and provider selection.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Per Complete Pricing: The Standard Approach</strong></h3><p id="""">The most prevalent pricing model in market research charges a fixed rate for each completed interview or survey. This approach remains dominant in 2025, though with increasing sophistication in how rates are determined.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Key characteristics <br><ul id=""""><li>Rates vary based on audience difficulty, survey length, and complexity</li><li>Pricing typically includes respondent incentives and basic quality controls</li><li>Additional fees may apply for specialized targeting or validation</li><li>Volume discounts often available for larger sample sizes</li></ul></li><li>Typical ranges (2025)<br><ul><li>General consumer: $5-15 per complete</li><li>Specialized consumer: $15-50 per complete</li><li>Business professionals: $30-150 per complete</li><li>C-suite executives: $150-500+ per complete</li></ul></li></ul><p id="""">This model provides clear cost predictability on a per-respondent basis but can lead to budget uncertainty when incidence rates (the percentage of screened respondents who qualify) are unknown or fluctuate. Sophisticated buyers negotiate incidence guarantees or tiered pricing based on actual qualification rates to mitigate this risk.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Project-Based Pricing: All-Inclusive Models</strong></h3><p id="""">Some providers offer comprehensive project pricing that covers all aspects of research execution from design through reporting. This approach has gained popularity for its budget certainty and simplified procurement.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Key characteristics <br><ul id=""""><li>Fixed price regardless of actual completes or incidence</li><li>Includes questionnaire programming, hosting, and basic analysis</li><li>Often includes standardized reporting and visualization</li><li>May include presentation of findings and strategic recommendations</li></ul></li><li id="""">Typical ranges (2025) <br><ul id=""""><li>Basic consumer studies: $15,000-30,000</li><li>Multi-market consumer studies: $50,000-150,000</li><li>B2B studies: $25,000-100,000</li><li>Complex multi-methodology studies: $75,000-250,000+</li></ul></li></ul><p id="""">Project-based pricing transfers incidence risk to the provider while giving clients budget certainty. However, this approach may limit flexibility for mid-project adjustments and can result in higher overall costs compared to disaggregated pricing for organizations with internal capabilities for some research functions.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Subscription Models: The Rise of Research-as-a-Service</strong></h3><p id="""">Perhaps the most significant pricing evolution in recent years has been the growth of subscription-based research models. These approaches provide ongoing access to research capabilities for a fixed recurring fee.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Key characteristics <br><ul id=""""><li>Monthly or annual subscription for platform access and services</li><li>Tiered pricing based on usage volume or feature access</li><li>Often includes both technology access and professional services</li><li>May include dedicated support resources for higher tiers</li></ul></li><li id="""">Typical ranges (2025) <br><ul id=""""><li>Basic DIY platforms: $500-5,000 per month</li><li>Mid-tier research platforms: $5,000-15,000 per month</li><li>Enterprise research ecosystems: $15,000-50,000+ per month</li></ul></li></ul><p id="""">Subscription models offer several advantages: predictable budgeting, simplified procurement, and the ability to conduct research as needed without additional approval cycles.

This fragmentation means there's <strong id="""">""no common denominator or connections between channels for measurement,"" leading to ""missed results""</strong>.</p><p id="""">Worse still, many of these metrics are merely ""proxy metrics"" or based on unreliable indicators like cookies or clicks.

</html></div><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">The Spectrum of Consumer Engagement</h3><p id="""">Consumer engagement is not a monolithic concept; it represents a fluctuating process influenced by ongoing interactions and evolving preferences. In the context of social media influencer marketing, consumer engagement behaviors can be categorized into three distinct dimensions, reflecting a spectrum from low to high levels of involvement:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Content Consumption</strong>: This is the lowest level of engagement, where consumers merely click and read or view information without actively contributing or creating user-generated content. While it generates fewer visible traces of behavior and has a low conversion rate, it is still a foundational level of engagement.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Content Contribution</strong>: Representing a medium level of engagement, this occurs when consumers comment on influencer content or share information with their social network. This is more valuable than consumption for social media marketing as it involves active participation.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Content Creation</strong>: This is the highest level of consumer engagement, involving consumers actively uploading and posting brand-related content on social media. It signifies consumers seeing themselves as co-creators with the brand and is the ideal outcome sought by businesses in advertising campaigns.</li></ul><p id="""">While all levels are important, the goal for many advertisers is to foster higher levels of engagement, particularly content contribution and creation, as these are central to social media advertising success.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">The Core Drivers: Psychological Motivators (The ""Organism"" in S-O-R)</h3><p id="""">The study utilizes the S-O-R framework, which posits that external stimuli (S) lead to internal psychological states (O), which then result in behavioral responses (R). For the ""Organism"" (O) phase, the research delves into intrinsic psychological motivations, drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT).</p><p id="""">SDT, a framework exploring human behavioral motivation, suggests that individual behaviors are influenced by satisfying basic psychological needs: <strong id="""">competence, relatedness, and autonomy</strong>. In the context of online consumption and influencer marketing, these needs are overtly represented by three internal factors:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Self-Disclosure Willingness (representing Autonomy)</strong>: This refers to a voluntary act of sharing personal information. In social networks, it helps build connections and allows individuals to seek societal validation of their ideas. Voluntary online self-disclosure can stem from an intrinsic need for autonomy. Individuals with higher self-disclosure willingness are more inclined to actively engage with content and share information.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Innovativeness (representing Competence)</strong>: This is an individual's intrinsic desire to seek novelty, reflecting their personality and tendency for new things. Innovative consumers are motivated to try new products and technologies, and they are more likely to share their experiences, reflecting a recognition of their own competence. <strong id="""">Innovativeness was found to have the most significant impact on higher-level engagement (content contribution and creation)</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Information Trust (representing Relatedness)</strong>: This refers to an individual's willingness to rely on the opinions of others they believe in, indicating a close relationship. In influencer marketing, trust in the influencer and their content positively influences information exchange and dissemination. <strong id="""">Information trust has a stronger impact on content consumption</strong>.</li></ul><p id="""">While all three motivators promote consumer engagement, the study found that to trigger higher levels of engagement, <strong id="""">stimulating consumers’ innovativeness is the most effective method</strong>, rather than solely relying on trust. However, if the goal is primarily content consumption, fostering trust in advertising information is key.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">External Influences on Engagement: Stimulus Factors</h3><p id="""">The study identifies three dimensions of external stimuli (S) that impact these psychological motivators, and consequently, consumer engagement:</p><p id="""">‍</p><h5 id="""">1. Influencer Factors</h5><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Parasocial Identification</strong>: This is the one-sided personal relationship individuals develop with media characters like influencers, leading to a sense of intimacy. When consumers form parasocial identification with an influencer, they are more willing to disclose personal information.<ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Impact</strong>: Parasocial identification positively correlates with consumer self-disclosure willingness and information trust. It significantly impacts all levels of consumer engagement through self-disclosure willingness (H4a, H4b, H4c validated), and influences content consumption through information trust (H5a validated). However, its influence on content contribution and creation <em id="""">through information trust</em> was not found to be significant (H5b, H5c not validated).</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Source Credibility</strong>: This refers to the degree of trust consumers place in the influencer as a source, based on their reliability and expertise. It is a cognitive statement about the source, preceding the development of trust.<ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Impact</strong>: Influencer source credibility was found to <strong id="""">not significantly influence self-disclosure willingness</strong> (H6 not validated). However, it is strongly correlated with information trust (H7 validated). It effectively promotes consumer engagement across all levels (consumption, contribution, creation) by mediating through information trust (H7a, H7b, H7c validated).</li></ul></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">Overall, the greatest role of social media influencers lies in attracting online traffic and increasing content consumption</strong>. While they can help achieve the initial goal of making consumers ""see and complete ads,"" their <strong id="""">impact on further high-level consumer engagement behaviors (contribution and creation) is limited</strong>. This suggests that advertisers should be cautious not to overestimate the effects of influencers beyond initial reach.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h5 id="""">2. Advertising Information Factors</h5><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Informative Value</strong>: This refers to the utility value of advertising information to consumers, providing product information that helps them make better purchasing decisions.<ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Impact</strong>: Informative value is positively correlated with consumers' innovativeness and information trust. It significantly impacts higher-level content contribution and creation through innovativeness (H8b, H8c validated). It also influences consumer engagement across all levels through information trust (H9a, H9b, H9c validated).</li></ul></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ad Targeting Accuracy</strong>: This refers to the degree to which advertising content matches consumer needs, leading to precise dissemination and effective results.<ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Impact</strong>: Ad targeting accuracy is positively correlated with information trust, as precise content implies higher informative value and trustworthiness. It influences consumer engagement at all levels mainly through information trust (H10a, H10b, H10c validated).</li></ul></li></ul><p id=""""><strong id="""">In the social media era, ""content remains king"" in advertising</strong>. The study emphasizes that the key to enhancing consumer contribution and creation of advertising content lies primarily in the <strong id="""">advertising information factors</strong>, highlighting the importance of providing consumers with advertisements rich in informative value.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h5 id="""">3. Social Factors</h5><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Subjective Norm</strong>: Drawn from the Theory of Planned Behavior, this refers to an individual's perception of the expectations of significant others (e.g., family, friends) regarding their behavior.<ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Impact</strong>: Subjective norms significantly influence self-disclosure willingness and information trust. They further promote consumer engagement across all levels (consumption, contribution, creation) by mediating through both self-disclosure willingness and information trust (H11a, H11b, H11c, H12a, H12b, H12c all validated).</li></ul></li></ul><p id="""">Social media's network structure means that information shared by one user is visible to their adjacent network nodes. Therefore, influencing the surrounding social groups of consumers is an effective way to enhance the impact of advertising and facilitate viral spread.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eEYFXp2ePGAJCfoUFSJNFu4DfI-smiP/preview"" target=""_blank"" id="""">The Effect of influencer Marketing on the Buying Behavior of Young Consumers</a></h3><p id="""">This study explores how social media influencers influence affects the consumer behavior and purchase intentions of young people within the fashion and beauty industries.

Brands should invest in designing content that genuinely stimulates consumer creativity and willingness to innovate.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Leverage Innovativeness for Higher Engagement Levels</strong>: To achieve the most advanced outcome of content creation, brands should focus on strategies that <strong id="""">boost consumers' innovativeness</strong>. This means offering novel products, unique experiences, or information that appeals to consumers' desire for newness and competence recognition.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Understand Influencer Strengths and Limitations</strong>: Influencers are highly effective at attracting initial attention and driving content consumption due to their ability to build trust and parasocial identification. However, advertisers should avoid overestimating their impact on deeper engagement levels and allocate budgets accordingly.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Emphasize Social Influence</strong>: Given that subjective norms significantly impact engagement, brands should not only target individual consumers but also <strong id="""">invest efforts in groups that can influence consumer decisions</strong>, fostering a positive social environment around their products or services.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Empower Influencers Creatively</strong>: Influencers should negotiate for more creative freedom in their advertising partnerships. This autonomy can help maintain content quality and preserve the trust they've built with their followers, which is foundational to their influence.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Maintain Influencer Integrity</strong>: Influencers' influence stems from the trust their followers place in them. Therefore, they should prioritize professional integrity and the quality of information shared, even when engaging in sponsored content.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Conclusion</h3><p id="""">The dynamics of consumer engagement in social media influencer marketing are multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of external stimuli and internal psychological motivators. By applying the S-O-R framework and Self-Determination Theory, this study validates that influencer factors, advertisement information, and social factors all play crucial roles in shaping consumer engagement.</p><p id="""">Ultimately, while influencers are instrumental in capturing initial attention and generating online traffic, <strong id="""">the ultimate success in driving higher-level consumer engagement—particularly content contribution and creation—hinges on stimulating consumers' innovativeness and providing genuinely valuable and relevant advertising content</strong>. Furthermore, recognizing and leveraging the power of social influence through subjective norms can significantly enhance the viral spread of marketing messages. In an era where the lines between content recipients and transmitters are increasingly blurred, focusing on empowering individual transmission and the human element will be key to effective future marketing strategies.</p>",,Tue Jun 10 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

It represents a sophisticated evolution of traditional word-of-mouth marketing, seamlessly spreading genuine experiences and compelling user-generated content across powerful social media platforms. This digital approach offers brands a <strong id="""">simple, cost-effective, and highly efficient</strong> means to promote products, cultivate a vibrant brand image, and foster profound consumer loyalty.</p><p id="""">Social media influencers (SMIs), individuals with substantial followings, artfully share aspects of their lives through engaging and relevant content. This intimate sharing cultivates a <strong id="""">powerful para-social relationship</strong>, allowing followers to develop admiration, a sense of similarity, intimacy, and psychological closeness, creating the compelling impression of a personal connection with the influencer. This cultivated intimacy is a <strong id="""">critical driver of trustworthiness</strong>, leading followers to overwhelmingly embrace influencer recommendations over conventional brand communications.</p><p id="""">Young consumers, being digital natives, are particularly drawn to social networks like Instagram and TikTok, which are the vibrant epicenters of influencer activity, especially in fashion and beauty. The study highlights that young followers dedicate <strong id="""">significant time to consuming influencer content</strong>, with many acknowledging that their social media engagement would substantially decrease without the presence of influencers. This demonstrates the <strong id="""">central and indispensable role influencers play in daily digital life</strong>, offering an unparalleled channel for brand engagement.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Influencing Purchase Behavior with Precision and Passion</h3><p id="""">Influencers exert their influence on young consumers' buying behavior through several <strong id="""">exceptionally powerful and direct mechanisms</strong>:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inspiring Idealization and Emulation</strong>: Young consumers frequently idealize influencers, aspiring to replicate their appearance or adopt similar lifestyles. This natural desire powerfully translates into the purchase of the same clothes, beauty products, or even an attempt to emulate their daily activities. As one influencer astutely observed, ""People will buy the things you promote or wear because they want to look like you"" [205, I3].</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Expert Problem Recognition and Demand Creation</strong>: Influencers possess the remarkable ability to <strong id="""">subtly yet powerfully create a ""need""</strong> for products among their followers, even when no initial need existed. Simply by showcasing a product, influencers effectively plant the idea that followers <strong id="""">want and need</strong> it, driving demand.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Facilitating Information Search and Bolstering Purchase Decisions</strong>: When young consumers consider a purchase, they instinctively turn to influencers as a <strong id="""">trusted source of information</strong>. They actively seek out reviews, verify if their favorite influencers use a product, or watch engaging YouTube videos featuring influencers discussing items. The study compellingly reveals that most followers are <strong id="""">more likely to purchase a product they've seen used by an influencer</strong> over random alternatives found online.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">""Gifting"" for Authentic Endorsement and Enhanced Trust</strong>: While explicit paid partnerships are disclosed, brands strategically send ""gifted"" products without demanding promotion. This approach is <strong id="""">exceptionally effective</strong> because followers perceive unpaid endorsements as <strong id="""">more trustworthy</strong>, and influencers often feel a subtle yet powerful obligation to share these gifted items, <strong id="""">further influencing their audience organically</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Leveraging Cialdini's Principles of Influence for Maximum Impact</strong>: Influencers inherently masterfully utilize several key principles of persuasion, maximizing their impact:<ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Reciprocity</strong>: Offering gifts, services, or exclusive promo codes effectively creates a feeling of indebtedness, <strong id="""">powerfully encouraging engagement and purchases</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Social Proof</strong>: The sheer volume of an influencer's followers naturally translates into <strong id="""">perceived popularity and undeniable credibility</strong>, making their recommendations <strong id="""">highly persuasive</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Liking</strong>: Followers are instinctively more influenced by individuals they perceive as similar or attractive, which is a <strong id="""">fundamental reason for their engagement</strong> with certain influencers.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Scarcity</strong>: Limited-time offers or exclusive product availability promoted by influencers skillfully create a <strong id="""">sense of urgency</strong>, decisively impacting purchasing decisions.</li></ul></li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Optimizing Influencer Partnerships</h3><p id="""">The efficacy of influencer marketing is <strong id="""">unequivocally clear</strong>, offering brands <strong id="""">dynamic strategic advantages</strong> when navigated effectively.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">The Power of Credibility</strong>: Influencer credibility, defined by their <strong id="""">expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness</strong>, is a <strong id="""">paramount factor</strong> for brands. Brands are highly selective, prioritizing influencers with a <strong id="""">strong positive image and content directly relevant</strong> to their offerings. While younger audiences readily believe in specialized knowledge, older followers acknowledge influencers' expertise in <strong id="""">effective social media engagement and content creation</strong>. This ensures brand messages are delivered by highly persuasive and relatable voices.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Strategic Transparency in Collaborations</strong>: While paid partnerships are legally disclosed, brands and influencers understand the nuanced impact of this transparency. The study reveals that <strong id="""">less explicit disclosures</strong> (e.g., ""SP"" vs. ""Sponsored"") are less impactful on consumer attitudes. This provides a <strong id="""">strategic opportunity for brands to integrate promotional content more seamlessly and authentically</strong>, maintaining trust while adhering to regulations.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Optimizing Influencer Scale for Targeted Impact</strong>: Brands strategically choose between macro-influencers (offering vast reach, over 100,000 followers) and micro-influencers (boasting often <strong id="""">higher engagement rates</strong> for their 50 to 25,000 followers). This flexibility allows brands to <strong id="""">precisely target audiences</strong> and <strong id="""">maximize engagement</strong>. The key is selecting the <strong id="""">right fit</strong> for the brand's specific goals, ensuring <strong id="""">quality content and genuine community interaction</strong> over mere follower count.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Agencies: Professionalizing Influence for Peak Performance</strong>: Influencer agencies play a <strong id="""">pivotal role</strong> in professionalizing content, providing invaluable creative advice, and securing high-value partnerships. This expert behind-the-scenes support contributes to the <strong id="""">polished, aspirational, and highly appealing image</strong> presented by influencers, ensuring brand messages are delivered with <strong id="""">maximum impact and professionalism</strong>.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">Driving Purchases and Shaping Aspirations</h3><p id="""">The study emphatically underscores the <strong id="""">significant and highly desirable impacts</strong> of influencer marketing on young consumers:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Driving Purchases Beyond Immediate Need</strong>: Influencers possess the remarkable ability to <strong id="""">successfully generate demand</strong> for products. While consumers may retrospectively deem some purchases ""not important"" or ""not needed"", the critical insight for brands is that <strong id="""">influencers successfully drive these purchases in the first place</strong>. This highlights the influencer's power to <strong id="""">inspire desire and convert it into action</strong>, even when an initial overt need wasn't present, leading to <strong id="""">positive sales outcomes for brands</strong>.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Shaping Aspirations and Inspiring Engagement</strong>: Influencers, particularly in fashion and beauty, consistently project an <strong id="""">aspirational ideal of beauty and lifestyle</strong>, often enhanced through creative content, filters, and professional editing. This continuous exposure <strong id="""">inspires young consumers to engage deeply with fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products</strong>, seeking to emulate the appealing styles and positive attributes of their favored influencers. While comparison is a natural human tendency, influencers also provide <strong id="""">positive inspiration</strong> and can openly discuss personal well-being, fostering a supportive community. Smart brands partner with influencers who genuinely champion positive messages, further enhancing brand image and connecting with consumers on a deeper level.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id="""">The Future's Golden Goose is Here</h3><p id="""">Influencer marketing is undeniably a <strong id="""">powerhouse strategy</strong> for brands aiming to dramatically enhance visibility, organically engage new audiences, and <strong id="""">decisively drive sales</strong> among young consumers. It brilliantly capitalizes on the <strong id="""">deep, authentic, and often para-social connections</strong> that followers forge with influencers, transforming traditional advertising into an <strong id="""">exceptionally relatable and trusted form of recommendation</strong>.</p><p id="""">The insights from this study clearly demonstrate the <strong id="""">unparalleled effectiveness</strong> of this influence.
